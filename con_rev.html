                    <blockquote class="blockquote">&lsquo;Imagine not believing in singularity.&rsquo; an optimist to a
                        pessimist.</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being an ardent believer in the singularity is a truly liberating
                        thing. One has to be cynical to believe that the world is meaningless and is always
                        going to remain in this pathetic state. Well, that cynicism breeds psychosis. One could
                        be in the biggest palace in the world but still be unhappy and depressed because of one
                        thing he/she didn&rsquo;t do yesterday which prevented him/her from doing something the
                        next day or tomorrow in their reference. This loss of the ability to test out the
                        consequence of an action is a major contributor to mental stress. If one forgot to lock
                        their main door while leaving their house and a burglar came and looted their valuable
                        belongings, he/she would suffer a mental pain far greater than anything capable of
                        giving them happiness at that moment. This fact is especially true when it comes to
                        parent child mistakes. Misunderstanding between a parent and a child can lead to strain
                        in the relationship between a father and his son and a mother and her daughter. The
                        general fact that one is not always going to take &nbsp;the perfect possible actions in
                        a given situation is a reason enough to cause a strain in two people&rsquo;s
                        relationship. Such is the case in today&rsquo;s world of massive online presence and
                        extremely warped perception of the situation one is in. How come a mere picture of a
                        naked lady stamped on a page of one&rsquo;s favorite magazine or a pixel representation
                        of the same picture on the display of a monitor is enough to elevate one&rsquo;s
                        hormonal levels that corresponds to sexual desires. This perverted reality many find
                        themselves is slowly but surely twisting the perception of young millennials and
                        children alike and giving them a worldview that is completely disjointed from the actual
                        atomic reality. Imagine a case where a kid falls in love with an online avatar of a man
                        of 40 years of age sitting in his basement disguised as a girl in her teens. The kid,
                        completely unknown about the actual man, thinks that the girl is all that exists. So he
                        is now a victim of digital fakery and anonymity. This is what happens when the physical
                        layer of reality is unable to interface with the completely disconnected construction of
                        the digital reality. Okay so what are we trying to prove here? Say in the future this
                        problem were to go away. Let&rsquo;s say by the year 2025. What would be needed to be
                        done for that to happen? The problem one can easily point to here is anonymity.
                        Anonymity gives oneself the freedom to do whatever he/she desires. Anonymity was
                        non-existent before the inception of the Internet. Before the arrival of the Internet,
                        people needed to sign on their letters, manually go to &nbsp;the post office, sign with
                        their physical pen and pay a certain amount to send a message to somebody across the
                        country or a continent. In a sense it is very limited. One had now way to make sure that
                        the message he/she sent had actually reached the intended person and not some imposter.
                        This problem is non-existent today. If you send a whatsapp message to somebody today,
                        you can be sure that he and only he has seen the message in his/her private device
                        whether it be a phone or a computer just by simply looking at the double mark under your
                        message. If the ticks are blue then the message has been&nbsp;sent and seen,&nbsp;if the
                        ticks are gray then the message has been&nbsp;sent but not seen&nbsp;and finally if the
                        tick is not plural but only one tick appears then he/she doesn&rsquo;t have the internet
                        connection required to receive your precious message. These ticks at that moment
                        determine the mental state of the conversing duos. The introduction of group chats by
                        facebook in the early 2010&rsquo;s made it easy for people to be involved in massive
                        gatherings privately. Before it&rsquo;s inception, people had to make do with various
                        rudimentary methods of gathering online. Forums in the early 1990&rsquo;s made it a lot
                        easier for people to share their ideas on the web2. The first version of the web that
                        was introduced by Tim Bernes Lee was known as Web1. It was only capable of displaying
                        text to the user when he/she requested it from their client device. The server would
                        fetch that request and transmit the necessary results through a wired channel to the end
                        user. In this case for example, the end user is someone requesting to see the New York
                        Times news article on the date of 1991 Sep 11, exactly 19 years before the devastating
                        attack on the twin towers that radically changed the airport security system which we
                        will talk about later in this book. So, the news article which the server at the new
                        york times stored would be retrieved by the computer that acted as the master computer.
                        It would then design packets called https packets. Packets are the storage containers of
                        data. With the inception of HTML 2, video, images as well as audio could also be stored
                        in these packets making it vastly superior for transferring movies through online piracy
                        then searching random dvd stores, *we will talk about piracy later in the book.* So
                        these packets would arrive through the sea cables which might not have actually been at
                        the sea at that time, at the user&rsquo;s computer. In this way the user would
                        &ldquo;fetch&rdquo; data from the server. The data would have been very consequential
                        unlike nowadays where the internet is flooded with utter nonsense, since it was a news
                        article discussing something important. In this way the internet was utilized by a niche
                        group of people earlier in the day. This thing which people later named web1 grew to
                        encompass vast swathes of the world. Since earlier people made due with just textual
                        information such as news that they could only receive but not post online or upload,
                        there was no problem of anonymity that we discussed above. People simply couldn&rsquo;t
                        &nbsp;troll, doxx, tease, blackmail, conn others online hiding behind a fake identity.
                        This was all well but it meant there was a limitation when one wanted to add changes to
                        the server without accessing the physical computer storing the data. To solve this major
                        issue, HTML2 was introduced that allowed for users to upload information to the web. The
                        ability to add information to the web meant people could now easily post new news
                        articles, their own journals and share what was there already by making packets of
                        hyperlinks to the original site and distributing those packets through a personal
                        channel. Thus was born a rudimentary form of social media and a sharing mechanism. These
                        techniques would see the light of the day in an actual social media platform much later
                        with the introduction of MySpace which was the early competitor to facebook in 2002. The
                        developers of MySpace and Facebook, Anderson and Zuckerberg were both the undergraduates
                        of Harvard University at Machheteutts. It was imperative for anybody that wanted to be
                        at the foremost of business and tech to enroll at either Harvard or at MIT. Both were
                        prestigious universities that provided college degrees considered valuable at every
                        corner of the world. So, HTML 2 that came bundled with the web2 was much more powerful
                        when it came to displaying images and video on the browser. This ability gave people the
                        early inkling of the coming digital age. An age when every little kid and his 80 year
                        old grandma would each have a tiny device fitting inside the pocket of their pants. This
                        upcoming revolution would mark the beginning of a new chapter in the history of mankind.
                        It is going to be much more historical than the Apollo moon landings and way way more
                        consequential since these budding technologies would for the first time change the ark
                        of human civilization. So let&apos;s talk about what happened after those data packets
                        reached their maturity. How ironic, right? We used to talk about maturity and getting to
                        old age in relation to humans and living creatures but this English word has now been
                        adopted to refer to all other things. We say we are technologically mature when we have
                        done something that the previous generation had no way of doing. Today the ease of
                        traveling thousands of kilometers to another continent by sitting in a chair inside a
                        capsule that is hurtling through the sky at 500 kmph seems nothing out of the ordinary.
                        But that would be complete magic to people from just the recent 19th century. They were
                        completely complacent in the fact that God had not provided humans with the ability to
                        touch the sky like birds and that we had no way of ever becoming like those birds. But
                        now since we are somewhat more technologically mature, this maturity has given us a
                        better sense of being more diligent and more thoughtful with what we can do with the
                        tools in our hand. Obviously these tools have been meticulously crafted by nobody other
                        than us but it is not necessarily true that the ability to design the tools was our
                        bringing. Evolution plays a vital role in the shaping of the human kind. In the past,
                        humans were able to survive because and only because we acted a bit more thoughtfully
                        and that was the reason nature selected us rather than other dimwitted species.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hallmark of this was to bring this maturity of our species to a
                        climax by presenting the whole world with a seamless communication protocol established
                        by a confederation that was volunteered by people all over the world. This confederation
                        was composed of all the internet users. Without the internet users, there would be no
                        internet ofcourse. The massive growth of the internet in such a short time is also an
                        indication &nbsp;that humanity desires to bring new things onto the table as quickly as
                        possible. Maybe this is the reason why the iphone was adopted by the whole world in the
                        means of other smart phones in less than a decade. This pace was unheard of before the
                        iPhone. Iphone truly marked a turning point in the history of the human species. It
                        wasn&rsquo;t just a toy for savvy people. It was a general tool that was able to be used
                        by the general public no matter how old or young. This ease of access is why it became
                        so popular and got adopted by the masses. What brings hysteria quicker than anything?
                        You might think of a disease outbreak. But you are wrong to think that. The quickest
                        possible time to bring hysteria is through a viral outbreak not in the real world but in
                        the social media world. Social media posts are quicker than any airplanes carrying
                        infectious strains. They can infect the minds of millions of users in mere minutes. This
                        extremely quick transmission of information which was unheard of before is the reason
                        why the nature of important public discussion and debate has now shifted to meaningless
                        online trolling and harassing.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c2">The</a> dilemma of different types of social media sites</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the introduction of the HTML2 convention, it was sure that the
                        web wasn&rsquo;t another geeky fiction. It was going to be real and realized soon. The
                        greatest thing about the ability of sending text, images and sound across the world was
                        that people no longer needed to feel isolated. They could now share whatever they
                        desired to whomever they wanted. This unprecedented ability was the reason why for the
                        incoming digital age, nobody was prepared. How could they be? The highlight of the show
                        were the browsers. Browsers such as netscape navigators and microsoft internet explorer
                        tried to make the task of searching through millions of hyperlinks embedded on top of
                        hyperlinks easier. They didn&rsquo;t quite succeed which is why their product got
                        replaced by an innovative solution invented by two undergraduates at Stanford. These two
                        geniuses were Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The web2 was firing on all of its cylinders by
                        the time they entered the scene. They were not the web pioneers trying to make it work.
                        The web was already working and got going. The web they had to browse however was so
                        unorganized and so messy to search through that one was hopeless in trying to find the
                        information they were trying to search. Suppose you want to find the recipe for an apple
                        pie. Today it is as far as a google search but in the days of Page and Brin, this
                        seemingly simple looking task could have easily taken an hour or more for somebody not
                        versed in the techniques of searching through that era&rsquo;s web. So how did it get to
                        where it is now? The page algorithm did the trick. It was a novel innovation from the
                        two that ranked all the pages in the web like a sorting algorithm but the sorting was
                        done for ranking them instead of measuring their size or something. This ranking system
                        is still used today by Google inc. No other system of providing the user with the
                        information they want has beaten Google&apos;s page ranking system. Page ranking system
                        is in no way optimal and easy to use. Users have to skim through several websites before
                        they finally find what they want. Basically the way the page ordering is done, the most
                        likely results the user would find useful appear on the top and the results that are
                        least likely to be useful appear at the bottom. Google&rsquo;s solution was so efficient
                        in the beginning that many didn&rsquo;t feel like they needed to find a better one. So
                        to not waste their time, they decided to give up on search engines after so many were
                        beaten during the first years by Google. So in 1999 Google released their software, a
                        browser capable of crawling all the hyperlinks on the web and ranking them to display to
                        the user. This software vastly improved the browsing experience and made it fun rather
                        than tedious. This ease in browsing introduced the internet to the even wider public.
                        The internet was ready to reach its maturity like other things before it. The television
                        era was going strong but there was a fear that it could be replaced by the internet soon
                        enough. With increase in the internet traffic, people could now share videos and watch
                        them on their browser. Videos were revolutionary. The fact that one could capture an
                        event in real time using image sequences and adding sound on top of it was revolutionary
                        when it was introduced. Videography changed the game and gave rise to the television
                        industry. That was now transfering to the internet. Early inklings of modern web based
                        television services like Netflix, Youtube were felt even at that time but no one knew
                        that they would surpass the legacy TV, Legacy TV was limited and still is. Today if you
                        want to watch a show on demand, you don&rsquo;t wait for days trying to catch the next
                        airing on a tv channel. You instead go to the online video provider that has the rights
                        of distributing the show and you watch it from thier website. To think that websites
                        were going to be so powerful one day 20 years ago was unheard of. Websites were
                        geeks&rsquo; hobby side projects and they didn&rsquo;t seem to change the world. Today
                        every actor, every sportsman, every writer and even every lucky kid in their prestigious
                        high school has their own websites with lots of content pertaining to them. One can
                        easily share these contents with anybody provided that they know the web address. Web
                        addresses are special markers that point to a particular website. All websites have a
                        web address. The digital inception required for physical presence to be accessible
                        through the rectangular screen of the computer. The computer was invented with the
                        intention of performing calculations to determine the trajectory of a bomb shell during
                        world war 2. The original plan worked out and they did that and the computers helped
                        immensely even turning the tides of the war with its power. But computers had the
                        potential to extend beyond this niche. War wasn&rsquo;t going to last forever, even a
                        war as visceral as ww2 was supposed to end someday. So the computers that were given
                        birth in that era had to find use after that era ended. And guess what use they found
                        for themselves? The primary task they found themselves doing was calculating virtual
                        shells inside a video game designed to provide entertainment to a 13 year old kid. How
                        crazy is that? A device originally invented to destroy the artillery shells of the enemy
                        got converted into a calculating machine for determining the trajectory of a laser fire
                        in a funky video game. Games have always been a big part of the internet ever since the
                        internet came into existence. Today I gather around in online chat groups primarily
                        through the social media site, discord. Discord is a social media app specially designed
                        to be suitable for gamers by providing easier methods to share links, gameplay videos,
                        timing of speedruns and other things like lobby and voice chats. Twitch similarly is a
                        video sharing website not unlike youtube but it is massively ahead of youtube when it
                        comes to gamers live streaming content to the world on the internet. Twitch became so
                        popular because it introduced novel features like clips, emotes and most importantly
                        paid messages. Paid chat messages became a way for the viewer to give money to their
                        streamer by simply paying a fees to highlight their message. Viewers can&rsquo;t do
                        anything in a twitch stream other than to post messages in the chat. So when the traffic
                        of messages increased, paid messages became a way for the streamer to notice and give a
                        shoutout for the viewer which made the viewer happy as well as the creator happy because
                        he got paid for that shoutout. If in the future web, say web3, viewers will engage with
                        their streamer ingame by hopping into a live session of the game on their pc because the
                        streamer shares their state through the new web, the interaction between the two would
                        dramatically increase because they both would be inhabiting a shared digital world. But
                        even with the introduction of the new web, this interaction would be impossible to scale
                        because there is only one streamer and thousands to millions of viewers. 10 viewers out
                        of that pool getting a chance to be featured on the big screen wouldn&rsquo;t really
                        bring any joy to the thousands of others that didn&rsquo;t get the chance. It would be
                        like trying to say that everybody that bought the powerball ticket won the lottery.
                        Scaling a interaction system to reach massive scale is very difficult because of the
                        constraints in the management aspect as well as the limitation of concentration group.
                        The term concentration group is introduced here only. It means that a large ensemble of
                        a thousand people will tend to form smaller subgroups of about a sie of of 100 and then
                        10 and then 5 or less close friends. This decreasing number phenomena is the reason why
                        social media sites are way way more popular than live streaming sites like youtube live
                        and twitch. Those sites don&rsquo;t allow this concentration group phenomenon to occur.
                        If all the eyes are focussed on one person, a gamer in this case then there isn&rsquo;t
                        any way for the humans that are just watching the stream to form groups. What happens in
                        social media sites is that an ordinary individual can become the content creator
                        themselves thereby satisfying their ego. That isn&rsquo;t the case with twitch. For you
                        to be popular in twitch, you have to win while all the others are simultaneously
                        competing with you. This form of utter online competition discourages one from trying to
                        be a twitch streamer in the first place. But nobody is discouraged from trying to be an
                        influencer on Facebook, why is that the case? The reason for that is that in facebook,
                        the competition takes place between close friend groups. These groups are much smaller
                        than the massive global twitch viewership. Remember that in youtube, one individual can
                        have millions of followers and millions can have 0 subscribers. In facebook however,
                        only public figures have millions of followers but millions have the average number of
                        friends count about a thousand or more friends. Meaning all those participants of
                        facebook get equal foothold in terms of their reach. This asymmetry of concentrating
                        social media sites like facebook and non concentrating sites like twitter is the main
                        reason why facebook has around 10 times the active monthly users of twitter. The
                        symmetry is hard to break. If twitter suddenly tries to reverse their design philosophy
                        and try to make their site more group friendly, that is having more options to reach a
                        local sparse user group around a particular user, they will still not be able to achieve
                        the success of facebook. Facebook is recognized as that quintessential social media site
                        that is all about you posting your baby photos and caring about your relative&rsquo;s
                        baby photos but not the baby photos of your distant cousin because he/she falls in a
                        different group concentration. People like being given equal attention as others. In
                        facebook it is possible to get 40 to 50 percent of the likes of the 90th percentile
                        highest like earning person. This might sound like a big deal but it is. On twitter, you
                        may get 10 likes if you are lucky but you are never ever going to reach even 1% of a
                        public figure&rsquo;s consistent like rates on your tweets if you aren&rsquo;t a public
                        figure yourself. On facebook the competition is between you and your equally popular
                        friends, that is there is a leveled ranking of you and your friends&rsquo; social order.
                        On twitter however, the competition is between you and famous individuals. This puts way
                        more pressure upon you for competing and you simply go back to competing with your
                        friends on facebook instead.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c3"></a>The conscious brain</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A baby is not supposed to be given electronic gadgets because that
                        may interfere with the natural development course of their brains. You may have heard
                        this from many people. People think phones and electronic gadgets are not natural when
                        they are made of the same stuff as the human body, that is atoms. Atoms don&rsquo;t care
                        if they are in a biological body or an electronic gadget made by that biological body.
                        They are just atoms and don&rsquo;t have any feelings. In the same way the information
                        comprising us is also not inherently different from any other object in the universe.
                        Both of them are made up of those atoms again. The fact that each and everything is
                        constituted of atoms is a fact worth deeply exploring in of itself. Atoms aren&rsquo;t
                        choosy. We are choosy. What makes us choosy or moody or put any other feeling in its
                        place is because of the emergent interaction of the same atoms inside of our brain.
                        Atoms aren&rsquo;t chosen but we who are made up of those atoms are. How could this be?
                        Ok let&apos;s take another non sentient example. Take a cup and take a picture of it.
                        Now break the cup and take a picture of it. Compare the two pictures. What do you see?
                        You see a whole cup in one picture and a broken cup in another picture. Both the
                        pictures are made up of atoms. One is broken and another is intact. What this means is
                        that one can be used for drinking and the other can&rsquo;t. The both are the same cup
                        but one is different functionally than the other. This asymmetry is present because the
                        final product built out of those atoms is more important than the individual atoms
                        themselves. How could this be? It&rsquo;s because of patterns. If the pattern of those
                        atoms are sufficiently different from what was the original cup, then they would be
                        different. Similarly if our brain is sufficiently different from what is capable of
                        thinking, then it would be like any other inanimate object. A mess of atoms incapable of
                        thinking and feeling. Consciousness is also the same maybe. If a thinking object is
                        sufficiently different from a biological brain then maybe it doesn&rsquo;t have to be
                        conscious. Maybe intelligence doesn&rsquo;t have to have consciousness. If this becomes
                        the case then the problem of how to handle an intelligent matter that feels emotions
                        would not arise. We could simply turn it off when not used and turn it again when used.
                        This is not the case with biological brains obviously. Biological brains require
                        nurturing with food and energy through oxygen. If they were completely electrical then
                        maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t need to feel emotions. Since they require food which is itself
                        in rare quantities they developed consciousness in the ancient past to outcompete
                        others.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The brain is a quite remarkable thing. It has the ability to self
                        contemplate which no other object in the whole universe can do. This is the one thing
                        that makes it much more different than everything else. The whole universe is seen
                        through the lens of the brain. The brain is the hallucinator and the whole universe is
                        the hallucination. This is something the neuroscientist Donald Hoffmann has taken quite
                        seriously for him to state that the whole reality is an illusion. That is nothing in
                        this reality is actually what it looks like. This means that not even the book reader
                        you are reading this on is real. You cannot hold your right or left arm depending on
                        which is free and say that it is real. You yourself are not real. This is why films like
                        The Matrix depict the illusion of mankind with so much believability. It is all
                        believable because it somehow is real. The atoms in your body aren&rsquo;t what they
                        look like. Right now the wall or the ceiling of you room looks like it is made of
                        various bricks and those bricks are made of those tiny atoms whatever they look like but
                        the thing is we don&rsquo;t know what those atoms look like. Those atoms can look like
                        anything at all and we don&rsquo;t have to care about that. This is the problem here.
                        The atoms are disconnected from our sense of reality but they are somehow a vital part
                        of the fabric that makes up the universe.&nbsp;</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c4"></a>The merger of two different human realities</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the past, people had to work day in and day out even in rich
                        cities just to make ends meet. In the villages, especially rural ones, one&rsquo;s life
                        was filled with constant chores and they had to be very diligent about doing those. If
                        one didn&rsquo;t work hard, they didn&rsquo;t get enough food that their body demanded
                        and they died. Today, there is something called SSN which stands for social security
                        number in developed countries that ensures that no one goes hungry due to unemployment.
                        Unemployment benefits are given to people that are unlucky enough to not find any job
                        for themselves for a long time. This doesn&rsquo;t exist in poor countries like India
                        however. In India one can easily die from hunger but the food is so cheap that with a
                        lowest quality job, one can fill their stomach.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Buying food was the same in the early 1990&rsquo;s as it was in all
                        the years before. It involved going to a restaurant or takeaway and paying bills to the
                        cashier. It changed radically with the introduction of online food ordering site
                        waiter.com in 1995. After that, many followed suit and many fast food chains started to
                        incorporate online food ordering systems. This revolution in how humans bought food gave
                        rise to a shift in mentality of eating. People weren&rsquo;t shy enough to buy tons of
                        food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. This became the norm of how people
                        ate fast food in their holidays. Due to its ease, many people gave up on trying to
                        prepare their own food and instead ate fast foods for lunch, snacks and dinner. This
                        brought in the past unseen problem of obesity to the people.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This same phenomena got into human-human connection with the advent
                        of chats and video messaging. Previously people used to communicate with their closed
                        ones using text on web2. Better internet connectivity with more data transfer rates,
                        someone thought of doing a video conference on the internet. This idea wasn&rsquo;t
                        really taken seriously by the public during that time but some didn&rsquo;t give up on
                        it. This led to the inception of face to face video chat on the internet. Today the
                        video interface has got better speed, less lag, low latency which makes it feel like
                        real time although there is a substantial delay in the perspective of the computer
                        processing speed. How on earth engineers managed to make video conferencing feel real
                        time and lagless is a mystery to many. There are layers and layers of stacks of highly
                        complex technologies that all come together to provide the user with an effortless
                        chatting service. Any web app today is built on top of layers of technologies.
                        Javascript is the engine running all the code. Javascript was a revolution. Before it
                        was introduced, there was no straightforward way of adding interactive elements on the
                        page. Every website has pages. Pages contain various elements that are kept in place by
                        the html scaffolding. HTML in itself can&rsquo;t do much. It is capable of displaying
                        text and linking objects but nothing more than that. It isn&rsquo;t a programming
                        language that is compiled. It simply displays its own text to the webpage but while
                        doing so self referentially deletes the scaffoldings kept in place by the user. To
                        actually design a website programmatically, one has to use javascript. There is no other
                        way. Every website has a javascript compiler which makes it possible for it to display
                        javascript elements on the website. Today one can easily assert without any debate that
                        90% of the world&rsquo;s MNCs depend either completely or partially on the web to reach
                        their customers. It is remarkable to see how something that simply didn&rsquo;t exist 30
                        years ago in any meaningful form has taken the world by storm and completely altered
                        &nbsp;the dynamics of the market. Every remotely substantial business has a fully
                        fledged programmatic web app. Just think of that for a second. Every food store, every
                        local business operating for a sizable chunk of customers, every government service,
                        every hotel etc has a web app to connect and interact with the customer. Yeah some
                        businesses don&rsquo;t bother with maintaining a website and instead make do with a
                        social media page but that still means that they depend upon the internet for their
                        daily operation. This has never happened in the history of human civilization. This is
                        all events happening in the path of humanity depending almost completely on constructed
                        information reality for its existence. Today humans communicate on the internet, dine on
                        the internet, shop on the internet, infact live on the internet. An average person
                        spends about 60% of his waking time in the vicinity of an electronic device actively
                        connected to the internet. He actively uses it most of the time while he is not
                        sleeping, eating or bathing. Many take their internet connected phones with them to the
                        toilet. This extreme attachment of humans to the internet is because humans don&rsquo;t
                        like to miss out. Once something arrives, humans will want to spend as much time with it
                        as possible. When there was no TV, no human was required to have a TV each for
                        themselves. But after they became affordable, there were no humans that could afford a
                        TV without one. This was a particular example. This applies to any new thing. The
                        Internet is the best example because the Internet didn&rsquo;t exist at all 30 years
                        ago. Today people spend 60% of their waking hours on the internet. How did this happen?
                        We are going to talk about that next.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Humans have fomo. Fomo refers to the feeling you get when you are
                        missing out on something you see your friend is not. This can include your friend
                        winning that lottery ticket or getting invited to a birthday party that you were not.
                        All of these cases induce FOMO. FOMO is not a comfortable feeling. It is a dreadful
                        feeling. You feel bad when you miss out. So when a new technology arrives, FOMO drives
                        everyone aware of that new technology to try it simply because they don&rsquo;t want to
                        get left behind.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is why when the internet was first introduced to a small public,
                        the people that didn&rsquo;t get the chance to try it wanted to. This drives its
                        popularity even more. Today this phenomenon is at an all time high. So much so that when
                        a small web app is released on the internet, people flock to it in mere hours. This
                        massive influx of customers trying to get their hands dirty with a company&rsquo;s
                        product makes it difficult for the company to scale its servers and provide its service.
                        Automatic backend scaling is something that is possible to do but many businesses
                        don&rsquo;t prefer it as it becomes prohibitively costly after a certain mark since
                        there isn&rsquo;t much competition on the expensive cloud service providing market.
                        Amazon, Microsoft, Google have occupied the market and they each take heavy pay for
                        their service.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This sudden flux of users to a new esoteric product that didn&rsquo;t
                        exist in any form previously happened with the app called clubhouse. It was released on
                        IOS on an invite basis. This invite system made the app generate even more FOMO among
                        people because of group play. When a friend gave their limited one invite to somebody,
                        that somebody got the chance to give their invite to somebody else. That somebody mostly
                        turns out to be another of his/her friends. All this leads to a game theory situation
                        with a dilemma instilled in each person expanding the app. The dilemma of who to give
                        the ticket to the app. Understandably people fought over the access for the app and many
                        started asking for an invite on other social media sites thereby increasing the
                        popularity of the app. Clubhouse took massive advantage of this.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was clubhouse, a app that is today not much talked about and
                        lurks in the shadows of other original social media giants. But the fact that a massive
                        number of people flocked on this app in such volumes teached many people a lesson about
                        human group dynamics. Humans are lonely creatures that fight for resources even when the
                        limitation is completely superficial and is artificially injected. Clubhouse
                        didn&rsquo;t have to limit its user base. The app was an audio group voice chat which
                        was perfected decades ago in the early phase of the internet to use as little compute
                        resources as possible. They did that to put artificial scarcity in something that
                        didn&rsquo;t have one originally and people loved it. They got trapped. This
                        ***artificial scarcity in a way extends to the entire human civilization which is
                        something we will talk about later in the book.*** But remember this fact that this form
                        of artificial scarcity will never go away because humans evolved through scarcity. If
                        food was plenty in the past then animals wouldn&rsquo;t have to go through the ordeal of
                        evolving and adapting. If everything was abundant then no animal would be eliminated
                        through natural selection. For natural selection, which is the hallmark of evolution, to
                        work, there is a non discardable requirement of scarcity. This fact has deeply embedded
                        several emotions into the human brain. The human brain loves seeing itself getting out
                        of scarcity while simultaneously watching other suffering in it if the person is not
                        someone they have built an emotional connection with in which case the feeling would
                        reverse and turn into sadness or pity. Happiness in other people&rsquo;s misfortune
                        arises in one mostly in the cases where that person has done something to him/her. All
                        this comes from evolutionary pressure to survive and sequester resources for oneself.
                        This thing extends to today&rsquo;s world even tho there isn&rsquo;t any pressure on
                        modern humans to compete with each other for survival. This sentiment arises from within
                        one&rsquo;s thinking. It is without any relation to the actual reality. The actual
                        reality is actually quite good even in this early phase of human technological
                        evolution. People have enough to eat fully, they have abundant water, abundant resources
                        for comfortable living, enough goods and services for some extras. Despite that, the
                        global human creature is always sad and always jealous and pathetic. The term that
                        refers to this ultimate dilemma is called &lsquo;The Human Condition.&rsquo; The human
                        condition is actually quite sad. It is difficult to imagine how humans have been able to
                        survive for millions of years with all these inherent disorders. But they have somehow
                        and the burden remains upon us to continue this for further millions of years. Two
                        things to take away from this are that humans are very resilient and that evolution is
                        pretty god damn powerful. It might even be one of the most influential and potent
                        emergent forces in the whole universe and don&rsquo;t take that last point for granted.
                        The universe is pretty big in fact infinite so there exist many more forces like
                        evolution operating in all subsets of physically possible realities. This fact should be
                        humbling enough for many deplorable humans pathetically fighting over resources they
                        already have enough of.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The humans in the jungle were more involved in community aspects than
                        today&rsquo;s humans. They all had actual scarcity to deal with, not artificially
                        generated ones. Scarcity was the uniting aspect of early human life. Today animals have
                        to deal with scarcity every passing day while the majority of humans don&rsquo;t have
                        to. True fact is that if the politics of the world and the mindset of people was even an
                        iota better than what it is right now, the world would&rsquo;ve already been converted
                        into a blissful utopia. The reason this hasn&rsquo;t happened is because humans
                        aren&rsquo;t guided by rationality to implement EA into the world. They are guided by
                        emotions and animal instincts that evolved in the jungle. Today we don&apos;t live in
                        the jungle so these emotions are completely out of place here. Let&rsquo;s talk about
                        where we are going with this. We are on the verge of something so massively disruptive
                        to the foundation of human culture that when it arrives, it will shatter all the
                        conventional wisdom we have regarding human nature, society, religion, truth, values,
                        pleasure, suffering etc. This is because we will soon enter an age when all of these
                        emotions that we today have to go through extensive measures just to experience them for
                        a short while will be able to be artificially created on demand. Imagine the morality of
                        such a world. Humans will no longer be put in place by natural conditions. They will be
                        able to change themselves inside out and make themselves ever more artificial. The dawn
                        of the day when such a thing will be possible will not just be any other dawn, it will
                        be the dawn of a hedonistic humanity. A humanity not shackled to the misgiving nature
                        but instead inseparably joined with the artificial construct.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the merger of the two different realities that is going to
                        happen. Let&rsquo;s discuss step by step how this reality is going to arrive starting
                        from today.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c5"></a>The world of today</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The world of today is an ever more interconnected and more human
                        world. The philosophy of humanism has guided man to be wiser, more compassionate, more
                        altruistic, more adhering to societal beliefs and overall better than before. This
                        psychological evolution of man &nbsp; &nbsp; is the reason why there are so many big
                        technological developments happening all over the world. Technology is a direct
                        consequence of rational thinking. When a group of people think rationally about a
                        subject, they get more and more involved in how to solve the problems regarding that
                        subject. Technology is just that, men trying to figure out solutions to age old problems
                        that have never been solved before and which finally have a hope for a solution because
                        of simultaneous advancements in other fields. This is how technological evolution works.
                        First man finds a problem. The problem may be related to low food production or massive
                        inflation rates. Then the man finds a group of other men who have matching views on the
                        subject. Then they form a coalition to work on the problem together to figure out a
                        solution. The solution may come from a single individual or may simultaneously emerge
                        from the whole group.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c6"></a>Timeline of technological progress</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Technological progress happens in a certain timely fashion. You
                        cannot expect to have an airplane today and therefore a rocket tomorrow. In reality, the
                        introduction of those two technologies has a gap of 30 plus years. Let&rsquo;s say that
                        a new prototype AR glasses is introduced by a startup in a chinese counterpart of the
                        silicon valley. Should apple be worried that it will finally overthrow the reign of the
                        iPhone by replacing all the handheld devices by a pair of sleek looking glasses. Surely
                        if the glasses were perfect beyond any obvious doubts, then that would be a massive
                        imminent threat to all iPhones and smartphones alike. But should Apple and other
                        companies be really worried? Does the timeline of technological progress allow for a new
                        breakthrough device on the level of a smartphone in less than 15 years? Do the
                        predictions made 10 years ago about another iPhone-like device match the glasses&rsquo;
                        description? This is the timeline of progress.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The timeline of progress was very slow like a tortoise pace in the
                        past. Today it is completely different. Due to advancements in better communication
                        between humans and better accessibility to technologies, technological evolution is
                        happening much faster. Some rightly believe this pace is accelerating which is something
                        this book will try to explain beyond doubt in the coming pages. This view was first
                        explained thoroughly by Ray Kurzweil in his magnum opus, &lsquo;The singularity is near,
                        when humans transcend biology.&rsquo;&nbsp;This book is regarded by many as the bible of
                        technological progress. The word singularity in itself doesn&rsquo;t explain a lot, but
                        if you see what it means and its implications, you will get a lot better understanding
                        of it. It is undoubtedly the single most consequential event to ever happen in human
                        history and that is something that cannot be easily said to a lot of things.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c7"></a>The aftermath of email and websites, innovation of crypto and NFTs</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first useful thing on the web was email. Email revolutionized how
                        people send post letters. Previously it was all physical or used fax to simplify the
                        transfer by photocopying the letter mail and sending it to another fax machine through
                        the existing telephone line. The telephone line was an analog system. It isn&rsquo;t
                        able to encode digital bits which is why it can send only sound which is an analog
                        signal. Analog is pretty different from digital. The Internet used digital signals which
                        is why it is incompatible with the old telephone lines. Today an improved digitized
                        version of the telephone line known as ADSL is used to access the internet in some
                        remote corners where fiber hasn&rsquo;t reached yet. This is actually quite innovative
                        since fiber is expensive as hell and isn&rsquo;t easy to maintain by an unskilled
                        person. Since telephone lines have existed for more than a century, people have gained
                        expertise in maintaining and repairing them. This is why ADSL still remains a primary
                        mode for connecting to the Internet for many people. Villages in Nepal still use ADSL
                        for example.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that&apos;s how email revolutionized the legacy mailing system. We
                        now have to talk about how the system is changing again. How it is moving from web2 to
                        web3, becoming more decentralized. How it&apos;s going to separate itself from the
                        control of tech corporations like google and microsoft. That&rsquo;s where crypto enters
                        the scene.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c8"></a>Crypto</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I were to transport you to 2012, just 10 years ago. The world
                        would almost look exactly the same but with less people having smartphones and
                        smartwatches. But you can be sure that you do not find anything called crypto. It is
                        such a recent phenomenon that it boggles the mind. Crypto became so popular so fast that
                        even in an accelerated technological evolution graph, crypto surpasses all the others.
                        The novel thing that crypto brought to the table was decentralized access to the
                        contents of a public ledger where information regarding transactions is stored.
                        Transactions don&rsquo;t just mean peer to peer money transfer. It also means messages,
                        pictures, video and all of the web2 components. Crypto actually completely changes the
                        web2 and transforms it into a completely different form called web3. Crypto uses
                        something called blockchain to do the transactions instead of relying on a centralized
                        server. This is done by utilizing individual computer stations of the users and
                        aggregating the partial computations to complete the encoding and decoding of a
                        transaction&rsquo;s 256 bit encryption. This process was truly revolutionary when it was
                        introduced in the original paper by a mysterious man known by his/her alias, Satoshi
                        Nakomoto. Nobody knows who Satoshi is but nobody can deny the contribution he or they
                        made to the world of Internet and finance. Today crypto trading, crypto currencies,
                        crypto tokens are all buzz words known to all the public. This rapid adoption of a
                        seemingly obscure technology proved one thing, that humans are capable of improving and
                        completely flipping over systems that have been put in place for generations. Imagine
                        the French revolution, the bloody massacre that overthrew the king and his
                        general&rsquo;s power. Crypto is basically doing that in regards to the legacy banking
                        system put in place since the inception of money itself in the Sumerian valley. Banks
                        hold so much power that if one bank were to go bankrupt that could easily disrupt a
                        nation&rsquo;s economy. Crypto is resilient to such market fluctuations.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c9"></a>Web3</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is going to be a long discussion so brace yourself. What do you
                        imagine the world to look like in 10 years? Probably nothing much different from today
                        when it comes to cities, nations and democracies. But if I paraphrase the question to
                        sound like, &lsquo;How do you think the world will improve in a decade?&rsquo; then you
                        wouldn&rsquo;t focus on the &lsquo;world&rsquo; as per say but the elements composing
                        the world. The technologies more specifically speaking that are present in the world
                        right now. You would look at one of the most important technologies that is the Internet
                        and would try to imagine how that would evolve at an independent pace from the physical
                        world. Since the web is completely free from the physical world because of its
                        electronic and digital nature, it is free to evolve at a considerably faster pace than
                        the physical world. The web has already completely disconnected itself from the
                        snail&rsquo;s pace of the real world. I mean just try to compare the speed of an email
                        to the pony express.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Web3 is more than just decentralized web2 however. It is designed
                        from the ground up to be a metaverse integrated web. How on earth is metaverse going to
                        fit in all of this decentralization parlance? Remember the promise of the web. It seeks
                        to connect the physical and digital reality. The physical reality is very connected. A
                        butterfly flapping its wings on one part of the globe brings a hurricane in another part
                        of the globe 10 years later. Sounds like bullshit but its true. Its called chaos theory
                        and its tries to map the consequences of small actions that turn big as time passes by.
                        This is how the physical reality is interconnected. The web is not. If you buy a 400
                        million dollar yacht from a website, that has no impact whatsoever on another website
                        where you are playing an MMORPG game. We want the digital world to be as much or more
                        interconnected than the physical world, otherwise the jump from one side of the lacuna
                        to another wouldn&rsquo;t give any substantial benefit. Metaverse is trying to close
                        that gap, that lacuna between physical and digital reality and seeks to make the digital
                        realm as interconnected to its elements as the physical world and objects making it. The
                        disconnection of the physical and digital reality isn&rsquo;t something that the web
                        designers failed to foresee. It is something very difficult to cope with. The electronic
                        and material object gap will never close since one is based upon atomic composition
                        while the other is wholly information based. Information is manifested in the form of
                        bits whereas the objects in physical reality manifest in the form of texture, density,
                        weight, inertia etc. Whereas a digital object on a web game instantiated through a
                        Javascipt 3d pipeline requires a 3d simulation engine like that of a game engine, the
                        real world simulates itself by self referencing it. This &nbsp;type of self referential
                        simulation is a very difficult concept to understand inside a digital system. A computer
                        simulation always requires pointers to a digital object that is to be simulated. For
                        example in a cloth simulation, the cloth has to be inscribed with several points that
                        are then individually simulated. Try to understand how far this is from individual atoms
                        simulation. Individual atoms constitute the matter they make completely without leaving
                        any room for trickery on the part of physics and chemistry. Atoms are the basic and
                        complete, &lsquo;complete&rsquo; is the important word here. They are the basic and
                        complete building blocks of any physical object that can exist in this universe. There
                        isn&rsquo;t any object that is made of stuff other than atoms. Atoms are self complete.
                        They are themselves the computers that are going to simulate the matter. Eacj atoms can
                        be thus be thought of as a CPU containing all the parts of a modern CPU than is able to
                        process a graphic volumetric physical simulation. A CPU has an I/O bus, a control unit,
                        a system bus, an accumulator, multiplexers and other memory components such as registers
                        and RAM. RAM does the most work when it comes to storing the state of a simulation at a
                        particular slice of time. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Web3 is designed to take advantage of the things that web2 does the best
                        and add on top of it things like distributive computing that takes advantage of the
                        computing power of the devices connected through the internet. This is a very good idea
                        since the majority of compute power is located with the public. Majority of computing
                        power isn&rsquo;t centralized in any way. Super computers are rare and servers even
                        rarer. If every device could be converted into a mini server for hosting the web3, that
                        would put less load on the individual servers and make web surfing generally faster. It
                        isn&rsquo;t however clear at this moment how this technology is going to be utilized for
                        the metaverse but we can always speculate and there has been a lot of speculation on
                        this matter. Let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NFT&rsquo;s are like the physical objects in the metaverse and crypto
                        is like the currency. Both of these things combine to make buying and selling things on
                        the digital market possible. Suppose you buy a sword from an independent marketplace
                        inside a rpg game you&rsquo;ve been playing that supports item trading. Now let&apos;s
                        say you want to sell that sword to a friend who plays a different game. Right now there
                        is no way to transfer the item from your game to your friend&rsquo;s game independently.
                        Either the makers of the two games need to implement a cross trade scheme otherwise it
                        is not possible to send information from one game to another without a universal API.
                        API stands for Application Package Interface. It is what connects the user side page to
                        the backend server of any app. What is amazing about APIs is that they are very
                        versatile when it comes to scaling. APIs can easily scale with requirements.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With web3, APIs are not needed in traditional form. They are
                        integrated within the blockchain which makes them an integral part of the web3
                        infrastructure. Web3 is fully decentralized which is why no government can raid a
                        building to get rid of a web3 app. There will be no web3 app that&rsquo;s going to be
                        more resilient than any other web3 app. They will all have the same level of security
                        and a maximum one at that.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c10"></a>NFTs</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crypto isn&rsquo;t the end of the story even in 2022. Crypto has done
                        many things. It has changed the mindset of the public to be more thoughtful and more
                        careful in regards to financial decisions. It has taught a lesson to traditional banking
                        establishments. It has introduced a new phase in the evolution of the internet. The
                        internet has now the potential to be decentralized. Decentralization can only mean one
                        thing. It gives less power to establishments and increases public trust for the
                        organization. The Internet has the potential to be safe for the first time in history.
                        It hasn&rsquo;t been safe before. Phishing, trolling, online harassment, black mailing
                        can be easily gotten rid of by putting checks and balances in the public internet
                        ledger.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NFTs by themselves aren&rsquo;t going to be that useful. RIght now
                        they are a toy for fidgeting round with various users. The real use of NFTs comes when
                        they are integrated into the metaverse. After that is done, the only thing remaining to
                        fully covert the human society is the immersion barrier. The use of NFTs guarantees
                        ownership of completely digital items that don&rsquo;t have any correspondence in the
                        real world and completely exist inside computers. They are manifested only when the
                        information about them that is stored in a server is processed or fetched to be
                        displayed to the customer. You may ask why would anyone need ownership of any item that
                        is completely digital? Aren&rsquo;t digital items abundant and are not limited in
                        supply? What goes into duplicating a digital sword in a game? Just some extra electrons
                        maybe but nothing more than that.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The answer to that is that the whole world is in a sense digital.
                        Every item is composed of information. Information is the thing that cannot be removed
                        about any physical object. What can be removed is the current information. Claude Shanon
                        who is considered to be the father of information theory describes this in detail. Only
                        a black hole is capable of eradicating the passt history of an object. Up until the
                        moment an object is consumed by a blackhole, it retains all the information it
                        constitutes. Same is with digital objects in a digital game. The interaction of the
                        object in the past with players is stored in a separate database belonging to it. This
                        database can be loaded and operations can be performed on it to retrieve all the
                        information pertaining to the digital object.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c11"></a>Inflation</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With any technological innovation, there is always the possibility of
                        reduction of prices. The old technology get superseded and the new more efficient
                        technology takes its place. This is how the world works in terms of macro economics.
                        Creditors put more and more money into the new technology which improves it even
                        further. This cycle repeats until the new technology reaches near perfection. Perfection
                        never arrives however and innovators have to work day in and day out to try to get it
                        closer to perfect. The obstacle that comes in front of such money flux is inflation.
                        Inflation devalues capital which is why a sum invested in a bank is worthless after 10
                        years due to inflation. That is why banks invest in diverse companies to feed off
                        innovation happening in various sectors. Inflation is actually bad for the economy which
                        is why governments try to decrease inflation rates as much as they can. Out of control
                        inflation leads to recession. Which is the biggest risk a rich country has to endure
                        from time to time due to unrestricted capitalism.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Technology however is a double edge sword when it comes to capital
                        valuation. It can simultaneously inflate as well as deflate the prices of products in
                        the market. The reason for this is because as the prices begin to inflate naturally over
                        time, the demand for digital and technological products also increases. In fact for
                        solely digital products, the consumer demand tends to increase exponentially. This shows
                        that the consumers are consuming digital services at an ever increasing rate. This
                        exponential rate is the reason why one day the demand will be so high as to be
                        comparable with a fully digital society in which minds themselves become digitized. How?
                        Well, through the natural progression of technology itself. Due to innovation in various
                        fields such as BCI and artificial intelligence, scientists and entrepreneurs alike are
                        predicting that by the year 2050, the world will be so different from today that it is
                        going to be imperative for humans to act like we are already in that stage in order to
                        quickly get the world&rsquo;s politics ready for such a transition. Today&rsquo;s
                        politics is completely disconnected from this reality.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c12"></a>Legacy Internet</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the above paragraphs, we talked about how innovation in technology
                        has brought humans closer to a new stage and how this will continue till they get to a
                        point in the future when all this will culminate in some kind of transition phase for
                        the whole world. Right now, that has already happened for information but by that
                        transition time, it will expand to include everything else. That word
                        &lsquo;everything&lsquo; is meant literally. We are literally going to witness in the
                        near future, the culmination of an ongoing revolution after more than a half a century
                        since the Internet was brought to the world. This is the peak of what humans can predict
                        in the 21st century. After that, nobody knows anything about the future. The future can
                        be anything you want. If you want it to be better than today, then you are in for a
                        ride. The future is really going to be better than what it is today.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today there is no way to prevent sound coming into your ears or block
                        smell coming into your nose completely although the second one is possible if you have a
                        gas mask but nobody is going to use one to stop some smell that&apos;s bugging them.
                        This is an extension of other impossibilities that arise due to the inability of the
                        human body to be switched on or off. The human body is not a digital device. There is
                        thus no perfect API that is able to interface between a human and an electronic device.
                        They are mutually incompatible. This mutual incompatibility is the reason why humans can
                        never be fully integrated with a digital layer until they are changed into one
                        themselves. This is a difficult task and we will explore it later in this book.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get into the discussion of the old internet from here.
                        The old internet is composed of servers and nodes. The nodes represent clients. Clients
                        are the building blocks of the network. The old internet didn&rsquo;t have one thing. It
                        didn&rsquo;t have the IOT.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IOT refers to all the non conventional things that weren&rsquo;t
                        traditionally supposed to be connected to the internet but are now today because of the
                        cheap price of putting chips into virtually any product. Today you can see chips inside
                        cars, fridges, toasters, ovens, fan etc. Consider the fan. 20 years ago, if somebody
                        told you that there would be chips inside fans 20 years later in the future, you
                        would&rsquo;ve thought them crazy and would&rsquo;ve never believed any sentence coming
                        from their mouth ever again. This is the reality of today. There are chips everywhere.
                        Chips are so abundant that if you sum up the computing power in all those chips, you
                        would cross 1 zettabyte of compute each second. This is how the internet is built and
                        expanded on top. The stack of the things that the internet connects is literally as tall
                        as a skyscraper.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the traditional internet that we are talking about. The
                        traditional internet works by relaying information from one device to the network and
                        relaying other information back to the device. This is the holy grail of today&rsquo;s
                        vastly interconnected world. Today&rsquo;s world is built upon the principle of
                        connection. Connection between two or more devices leads to them being a whole in a
                        sense. This sum of parts is greater then the individual sum is a big idea. You can see
                        this happening all around the natural world. Natural world is filled with things that
                        show emergence when they are working mutually.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c13"></a>New Internet</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The new internet that will come after the legacy internet is going to
                        be very different in the sense that it will utilize new technologies like blockchain,
                        NFTs and decentralized computing to greatly amplify the power and distribute the control
                        of the Internet. The new Internet will not be controlled by anybody. This internet will
                        be truly free and turn into the pillarstone of censorship free communication finally
                        giving free speech to nations still ruled by an autocratic regime.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, what can one expect to do on the new internet? Well, many things.
                        The first being the ability to host your web3 app without relying on legacy
                        infrastructure controlled by internet giants such as google, microsoft etc. This will
                        keep your web app safe from infiltration by a hacker or virus targeting a specific
                        company&rsquo;s server rack. There are other benefits as well of the new web. The new
                        internet will be built from the ground up taking advantage of several technologies used
                        in creating the metaverse. These technologies are going to be the pillar stones of the
                        new web. What makes the new web so attractive?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Previously the internet worked by transferring packets through
                        network protocols operating on small network clusters that had clients. Nowadays,
                        it&rsquo;s the same idea but on a vastly huge scale. It hurts to try to understand the
                        scale of today&rsquo;s web. Todays web is so interlinked that it is difficult even for
                        Google with its massive server racks to map out all the relations of the network.
                        Networking has seen a lot of improvements in the past 2 decades. It is no more simple to
                        connect and extend. Today it is more like connect, extend, improve latency, speed, add
                        routers, add relays etcetera. How the internet functions today is beyond anybody&rsquo;s
                        understanding.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The new internet will be similar to the old when it comes to
                        accessing information. The new internet will be once again composed of websites but this
                        time, the websites will be much more integrated.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c14"></a>AI on top of web3</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AI is the future whether you believe it or not. The AI revolution
                        that began in the early 1960&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t see continued growth due to various AI
                        winters. But with the advancements in theory and computing, AI once again became
                        mainstream with the introduction of neural nets. Neural nets are loosely based on the
                        biological neurons. Nodes are the counterpart of neurons in an ANN. Artificial neural
                        networks are the hallmark of current AI methods. Machine learning, the branch of
                        computer science that deals with the instantiation of intelligence on the computer,
                        gained much popularity in the previous decade. Pioneers like Geroffrey Hinton and Yann
                        Lecun that developed neural nets and convolutional neural nets respectively pushed the
                        field miles ahead. The expansion of web and web related technologies in the public
                        brought AI to even more popularity. AI is used today in virtually all websites operating
                        for a massive customer base. Netflix uses AI to recommend the web series a user is most
                        likely to watch. Youtube uses various AI algorithms to fill the user feed with videos.
                        Facebook uses AI to suggest new friends to a person just getting started on it by
                        mapping out massive datasets of already existing users. Google uses extensive AI
                        algorithms to display ads to the user.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All these examples were based on legacy internet. With the web3
                        internet on its way, AI will be integrated in the foundation of the internet itself. AI
                        is a general technology. It is not limited to one field. If you build a chatbot, it can
                        virtually be integrated anywhere it suits. Restaurant? Yep! Airplanes? Definitely! With
                        decentralization being the pinnacle of web3 and generalization being the pinnacle of AI,
                        the ultimate culmination will happen with the introduction of a democratized super
                        intelligence free on the web itself. Also referred to in pop culture as Skynet. But
                        Skynet is evil whereas web3 superintelligent AI is going to be benevolent.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c15"></a>Metaverse</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Metaverse, initially an unknown term that became widely known to the
                        public when the facebook company changed its company name from facebook to meta, is a
                        term used to describe the digital reality on the web that is coming together in little
                        steps in order to become a fully fledged thing like physical existence. This term also
                        carries some baggage of hate associated with it. People think of the term as meaning
                        nothing and not being useful for anything. Memes are made regarding metaverse all the
                        time mocking it. But the thing is, metaverse is actually a quite good word to describe a
                        future in which the digital reality is going to be as consequential as real reality. At
                        what point, people will start to ask what&rsquo;s even real. Were the reality they were
                        living all this time the real reality or just some metaverse created by aliens to
                        explore alien lifeforms and cultures. This is called the simulation hypothesis and it
                        gets quite serious when we try to look at its implications.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Metaverse is something much more than just virtual reality. It is
                        quite amazing that this term has gained mainstream recognition so early. One day, we
                        will eat in metaverse, sleep in metaverse and live in metaverse. That day is yet to come
                        but there is no doubt that it will come. Before that day comes however, we must
                        understand that this is not some new technical jargon that&rsquo;s been thrown around.
                        It is something that&rsquo;s going to be as important as the Internet and something that
                        will ultimately save humanity from extinction. We will talk about extinction in *much
                        more detail later in the book.* So, the metaverse is very important, we get that. How
                        are we supposed to take it right now? There are many articles that get published each
                        day related to metaverse. These articles describe how the technology is progressing and
                        how the facebook company is falling short in its promises. For now we can only hope
                        however that the difficulties facebook is facing regarding absent legs of avatars in its
                        much marketed VR app called&nbsp;&lsquo;Horizons&rsquo;&nbsp;and other things inside the
                        company is temporary and that they will deliver on the promise of the first real
                        metaverse. If this happens, we can only conceive the changes it will bring to society.
                        The metaverse is a truly powerful thing and it is shaping up to be great in the future.

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c16"></a>New more powerful Internet</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the arrival of the web3 super ai and the arrival of the mature
                        metaverse, the internet is not going to stay the same. It is going to be even more
                        powerful and better. Better in the sense that it will be more interactive. Currently,
                        you access the internet with a browser. In the future, there will be various APIs
                        integrated into various devices that will offer seamless connection to various internet
                        services. Autonomous cars will use proprietary APIs to communicate with other cars to
                        avoid collisions and guide their traffic. Humans will use light weight APIs to connect
                        to the internet with their wrist watch. With the advent of the 5G network all around the
                        world, this completely IOT based world will become a reality and that will make the
                        internet even more interconnected making it more powerful than ever. Let&rsquo;s outline
                        how powerful this new internet will be.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This new internet will obviously be based on web3. Web2 was never
                        perfect. Web3 will get rid of the problems faced by web2 and use a more powerful
                        architecture to streamline the data transfer process. This new architecture will have
                        lots of features which we can imply through a demo. Let&rsquo;s construct a web3 for
                        demonstration.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The network has 5 nodes. Each node is a computer that can handle web3
                        related queries and operations. These operations can range from simple number factoring
                        to something orders of magnitude more complex. Say node 1 is us. We control node 1
                        basically. The OS of the node 1 is inside our computer. The computer thus has to
                        interact with the OS which then interacts with the web. Since the kernel is completely
                        isolated from the web, there is no reason to worry about infiltration. This is the
                        fundamental security feature of self contained devices. Now let&apos;s connect the
                        computer to web3. After connection, the computer will act as a part of the web. The web
                        will function completely reliant on individual computers or nodes like yours. That is
                        our design specification of the web. We now choose the encryption scheme for the
                        blockchain. Let&rsquo;s use a 256 bit encryption scheme that will provide the data in
                        the web security from infiltration and hacking. Doing that, the mere connection of
                        various computers turns into a powerful data exchange and data computer pathway. This
                        type of web is so much more powerful than lan cable internet. This web can be easily
                        modified to train large neural networks by parallelly training the network on small
                        chunks of data on individual computers. What&apos;s more is that this versatility
                        isn&rsquo;t even the most powerful feature of web3. Web3 has the ability to do inference
                        of supersized AI models i.e it can do realtime inference on huge AI models thereby
                        gaining the ability to contain a super intelligent AI in its network. That super
                        intelligent AI can be used in various ways, way more than just search and data transfer.
                        That AI will literally change the globe in unimaginable ways.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the above case, we envisaged a super ai forming on top of the 256
                        bit encrypted web3. That is unlikely to be the case. We really don&rsquo;t have a vivid
                        idea of how such AI entities will exist. We don&rsquo;t even know if they can be
                        considered to be conscious when they exhibit conscious behavior just like humans. We
                        lack the fundamental theory of consciousness itself. Without it, anything we say
                        pertaining to it is just pure guesswork. Yeah, maybe one day we will develop a mature
                        theory with lots of experimenting and verifying but until that we have no idea of the
                        solution to the question of consciousness. When it comes to the digital age, it looks
                        like we are on the top of the tree overlooking beautiful Savanna which we just crossed
                        encountering various obstacles on the way but then when it comes to gaining full
                        understanding of the workings of our brains, it looks like we are at the bottom root
                        underground.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c17"></a>Friendly UIs</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bread and butter of APIs is the UI. Without a good UI, APIs will
                        cease to offer their functionality to the user. A person would never be able to interact
                        with their phone if the UI was a complete dipshit. Good user interface is like candy. It
                        melts the eyes and convinces the user to click on it instead of clicking away. This is
                        where aesthetics and beauty come into play. If an application is designed with beauty
                        and friendliness in mind, the user will use it even more. Web became more and more
                        popular as time went on due to the advent of dynamic UI elements and programmatic pages
                        with the introduction of the Javascript language.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since javascript will not be used on the backend side of web3. Will
                        that affect the user facing side of a web3 website? If so then how will the UI evolve
                        when web3 arrives? Lets look at the implications of web3 on user interfaces by giving a
                        tangible example. Lets make a web3 app, call it twitter 3.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Twitter 3 will be made using web3. The current twitter can be changed into twitter 3 by
                        doing the following things:</p>

                    <p>1) Change the UI to look completely different in an attempt to make it way more user
                        friendly so that people, mesmerized by its beauty, just wouldn&apos;t want to leave the
                        app. Would that be possible?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Certainly! For that one must know about the beauty and aesthetics of
                        a good human machine interface. The original cockpit of the space shuttle was so clunky
                        and boring that one would give up their dream of going to space because of it. But place
                        that person on SpaceX&apos;s dragon capsule and they would be willing to go on a 6
                        months Mars adventure because of how beautiful and modern the Dragon&apos;s cockpit is.
                        The UI is the same. UI must look modern, simple and be pleasing to the eyes while
                        offering even greater functionality then before.</p>

                    <p>2) Add the ability to add a section on each tweet that can act as a reference to the
                        source material to the tweet. Since tweets are basically information in condensed form,
                        they must have their bibliography just like non-fiction books.</p>

                    <p>3) Greatly improve the clubhouse counterpart i.e spaces of twitter to support video in
                        the form of 3d face scans of the speakers with the ability to add virtual sets to bring
                        the feel of the metaverse into twitter. This will be done using neural network encoders.
                    </p>

                    <p>4) Make the NFTs thing on twitter much more serious than just profile pictures by adding
                        the ability to trade any NFT within twitter using a new NFT marketplace icon on the app.
                        This marketplace will be hosted on web3.</p>

                    <p>5) Make the mute feature that currently exists on twitter much more effective by giving
                        user the ability to not just mute a single person but the entire group of people that
                        support the ideas, views and philosophy of the muted person. Basically giving users
                        ability to personalize twitter.</p>

                    <p>This will be done by using advanced neural networks capable of clustering groups of
                        people in terms of their belief system.</p>

                    <p>6) Convert the whole app, not just the NFT marketplace into a web3 app. This will allow
                        twitter to become truly democratized in theory and in principle. With this, the
                        government will never be able to raid twitter headquarters to destroy its opposition if
                        it ever turns autocratic</p>

                    <p>7) Make twitter much more than just a short message texting app. Double the character
                        limit. Make threads more useful. Add the ability to monetize long form tweets just like
                        articles on online journals. Add the ability to tip the creator for their tweet etcetera
                        etcetera.</p>

                    <p>8) Make the app just more fun while fulfilling its original intent that the creators
                        envisioned for it.The description of twitter may have changed over time but its
                        philosophy remains the same: To bring civil and honest discussion of important topics
                        about humanity to the public.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More things were implied in the above example than just UI but it was
                        done deliberately to demonstrate the power of web3 which was tried in the previous
                        paragraphs. Web3 will completely change UIs. With the current web, the internet has
                        already hit the peak of development. Now the only thing remaining is a totally new
                        paradigm that will be brought by web3. Web3 will be that paradigm and will bring
                        innovation in the web. Obviously this is going to be great even though a lot of people
                        are concerned about the unsure future. If people can perfectly bring web3 into this
                        world, that will be the greatest thing to ever happen to humanity since the initial
                        introduction of the internet itself. This is why this technology of connecting humans
                        with each other is so important. It extends beyond just connection between people.
                        Actually a new kind of science emerges when humans are connected beyond natural means of
                        voice and touch. The internet has given birth to this kind of science. This science of
                        networking has broken the barrier of so many stereotypes that it has pushed human
                        culture forward in unimaginable ways. The rise of anti suppression protests across the
                        world, the rise of revolutions, the rise of voices of the betrayed are all an indication
                        of the power of this massively potent technology. This technology is the sole reason a
                        person living in the middle of a poverty struck village in a poor country can learn the
                        trade of foreign people to get income flowing into his crypto account so that when he
                        sells it at a price higher than yesterday, his family who know nothing about what their
                        member is doing can at least expect to eat a meal that day. What jobs can be done on the
                        internet? There are so many that one finds it difficult to even list the categories. But
                        some include, freelancing, which is massive by itself, youtube content creation,
                        influencer business, bug hunting, streaming on twitch, reddit, discord and other sites
                        moderation etcetera etcetera. All these internet jobs pays one dearly with the
                        moderation one paying the least. Freelancing, although immature and not easy to get into
                        at this time, is however the most promising one. With freelancing, you can expect to do
                        the job of a person sitting across thousands of miles and get paid dearly for it. There
                        is no risk of scam or anything since good freelancing sites make sure that the person
                        who is ordering the job has paid the money to the site so that when it comes time to
                        accept the result from the person, he/she cannot deny them the money. This is still not
                        a perfect solution however. One can always get away with scams and con if he/she is
                        intelligent enough to see through the veil of the web2, how it works, how its designed,
                        how the packets of confidential information are transferred through server to client in
                        jQueries, how he/she can intercept it etcetera etcetera. This is the reason why web3
                        will be the booster of the internet. It will be like that vaccine you got when you were
                        a kid that prevented you from dying in your early childhood. Web3 is a vaccine for
                        humanity&rsquo;s most important technology, the first type 1 technology, the
                        internet.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c18"></a>User friendly devices</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UI isn&rsquo;t the end of the story. Devices should be user friendly
                        too if they are expected to be used by the public. A clunky phone is going to be
                        disliked by everyone but a sleek and stylish phone will have everyone relishing over it.
                        Before the Iphone, nobody bothered to carry a huge laptop with them everywhere but with
                        its and other smartphones&rsquo; arrival, people have been carrying the internet with
                        them to the toilet. This is what happens when devices get more connected to the user
                        instead of getting more disconnected. People prefer phones way more than big computers
                        because of their ease. Now for heavy duty tasks, PCs are still used contrary to the
                        belief of Apple that the Ipad was the new laptop. But for day to day activities if one
                        could just check their phone instead of booting up their PC, then they would prefer the
                        first to the last one.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do you imagine the future of smartphones to look like now that
                        we have had 10 plus years to think about the next thing. One is likely to point towards
                        smaller devices that will be more connected with the user but the reality is the devices
                        will not just get smaller and more integrated, they will get inside the user becoming
                        whole with them. Although phones with more performance were the trend in the 2010s and
                        first half of 2020s, they are not the trend going forward. The new trend will be
                        miniaturization at a whole new level. Remember that as the years went by, phones
                        didn&rsquo;t get smaller but instead got bulkier. This became a problem. Instead of
                        getting iglasses or iwear we got ipad and itv although the marketing term is apple tv.
                        Although Apple released the Apple watch as their new computing device with a small form
                        factor, we haven&rsquo;t progressed an inch from that. Apple watch became the smallest
                        mass manufactured computing device. No product was ever announced after it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why? Why did that happen? Didn&rsquo;t Kurzweil predict smaller
                        devices as a continuation of the law of accelerating returns. Aren&rsquo;t we supposed
                        to get from the iwatch, to iglasses, then to ibrain or something which will lead to the
                        ultimate blood cell nanotech gadget? Kurzweil may have missed one thing in his equation.
                        The thing he misses is that going from phones to eye glasses wasn&rsquo;t ever going to
                        be so easy. Today so many companies hype the public by announcing their digital glasses
                        but up until now, none have actually delivered on their promise of a working AR glasses
                        however expensive. It is understandable that one or two companies producing an eccentric
                        device are naturally going to price their products at a premium. What isn&rsquo;t
                        understandable is that they haven&rsquo;t produced any product smaller than the watch
                        Apple introduced 10 years ago in 2013 which became available to the public in
                        2014.*dates may be wrong by a margin of a year or so* Which means even with the last 10
                        years of no new breakthrough wearable computing device coming to the market, no startup
                        or no tech giant has been able to make an equally performing alternative device with a
                        smaller form factor. Xiaomi tried and failed, Google famously with their google glasses
                        tried and failed, Microsoft with their famous holo lens tried and failed, meta with
                        their ar glasses made in partnership with Rayban tried and failed and etcetera etcetera.
                        This can only mean one thing, that the problem of miniaturization after a watch is
                        beyond human intelligence. This can then further mean only one thing, that humanity has
                        hit the roadblock in better user friendly devices. That means that in the last 30 years,
                        laptops haven&rsquo;t progressed an inch in terms of user friendliness, desktop
                        haven&rsquo;t progressed an inch towards user friendliness, tablets and smartphones in
                        the recent 15 years haven&rsquo;t progresses an inch towards the same, watches in the
                        last 9-10 years or so haven&rsquo;t progressed an inch towards the same and finally the
                        smallest form factor of them all, ar glasses or virtual reality gear haven&rsquo;t
                        progresses an inch since their first real introduction in 2013 by Oculus, towards user
                        friendliness. So then are we stuck with bulky and unwieldy VR glasses, laptops,
                        smartphones that have been the same for 10 years, watches the same etcetera for the rest
                        of our lives? Well, if you thought that, you forgot to put one thing in the equation
                        which Kurzweil didn&rsquo;t. You forgot about the first general AI that will soon come
                        in this decade.&nbsp;</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c19"></a>General AI</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I talked about web3, I injected something about a
                        superintelligent AI that could potentially be housed on the new web. This was just a
                        speculation of course but something like that isn&rsquo;t out of the question if
                        developments in hive mind-like technologies take the world by storm. But the question
                        is, even if such a miracle were not to happen, can we still expect an AGI to arrive by
                        the time 2030s kicks in? If companies like OpenAI continually increase the size of their
                        AI models to a few trillions of parameters, would such scaling be enough to inject
                        actual reasoning into the NN model? Skeptics don&rsquo;t believe that such scaling would
                        be enough to make a truly general AI. Some sci-fi authors think that the only thing
                        thats required to make a general ai is a body. An actual body and an actual brain would
                        just correspond to a human but a robot with an artificial mind and artificial appendages
                        could be considered more than a machine and closer to human. Ofcourse how close would
                        depend upon its likeness to a human in terms of looks as well as cognitive abilities. If
                        a baby is easily able to surpass it in some common tasks, all the effort that went into
                        building it would go in vain. To prevent such expensive accidents, researchers have
                        developed several theories of intelligence and linked them with theory of computation.
                        When doing that they found that computers are faster, more power hungry, way more
                        logical and generally much more dumb when compared to a fleshy brain of an animal. This
                        discrepancy is the reason why many scientists in the field of neuroscience believe that
                        computers will never surpass humans in intelligence. Kuzweil however believes that all
                        this luddite thinking is the consequence of lack of exponential thinking on the part of
                        those scientists. He believes that due to humans having linear thinking hardwired into
                        their brain, they are incapable of thinking exponentially and thus correctly. This is
                        certainly true as evidence shows that humans didn&rsquo;t even predict the arrival of
                        pretty groundbreaking technologies like airplanes just weeks before they became reality.
                        That is some intense backwardness on the part of humans. Kurzweil was so upset to see
                        this phenomenon that he founded a university along with Diamandis that tought
                        exponential thinking to its students. The Singularity university, which it is named, is
                        a talent assembling institute that produces extremely capable entrepreneurs that are
                        able to think of much further in their company&rsquo;s future timeline. The ability to
                        imagine the state of the world as it will be when the product or something that you have
                        been working on is introduced, is a very powerful tool for entrepreneurs. This develops
                        greater flexibility on the part of the company&rsquo;s owner and guides them with a
                        vision that helps them in achieving success.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, in the eyes of exponential thinkers, the arrival of true general
                        AI is nigh. The thing is when that arrives, the world would not be politically stable to
                        decide what it shall do with it. Nations might fight over resources allocation since a
                        general AI will certainly find a way to put all the resources to use and maximally at
                        that. The decisive factor on who shall win the world with this technology depends upon
                        how easy it will be to replicate or steal this technology. If only Google has access to
                        it and everybody else is lagging far behind them, the guys at Google will have a much
                        greater advantage when it comes to conquering all the markets of the world. AGI is
                        something way more powerful than you might think. It is not just a tool but a tool to
                        change the tool itself, that is, it will have the ability to improve itself much more
                        rapidly than petty humans.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With all of that, do I think that humans will be ready by 2030 when
                        this technology will first arrive into the world? Maybe or maybe not, but in any case I
                        don&rsquo;t think humans will be an important part of the equation. A general AI much
                        more intelligent than humans but not quite as intelligent as superintelligent AI, is
                        certainly going to be able to predict the actions of humans and tell them beforehand
                        that what they are going to do is going to lead to bad consequences thereby stopping the
                        bad choices of the humans. If the AI alignment experiment plays out successfully then
                        one would not need to worry about AI doing work for the bad actors. One can sit in their
                        chair and relax with the fact that the AI that has been let free into the world will
                        stop from committing any harmful or damaging actions ordered to it through its
                        volition.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c20"></a>Automation</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is automation? Simply speaking, automation is the application of
                        machines to do the work for humans. This saves workers from doing manual work for
                        difficult jobs and thus increases safety and decreases risk of injuries and accidents.
                        Automation is done using robots which are completely free to operate if we discard
                        electricity charges. This is the thing that will grow the economy to such levels that no
                        human would ever need to die of hunger or poverty. With the arrival of general AI,
                        automation will kick into high gear and will rapidly change the economic landscape of
                        the world. Germany and other countries of Europe would no longer be the engines driving
                        the world. With high tech automation, every country would have equal footing
                        economically, potentially limited only by the resources on their side. If China has more
                        resources than the USA then good for them. If India has more population than China then
                        bad for them. Today&rsquo;s correlation that exists between economic potential and a
                        nation&apos;s population is going to go away. No longer will India joy over the fact
                        that it has the largest population in the world because a large population would mean
                        larger unemployment and that would mean more UBI for people. Since more UBI would mean
                        more capital allocated for consumption rather than production, it will cause a dent in a
                        country&rsquo;s economy. This reason is why some skeptics even believe that UBi will
                        never become a reality, that the overhead cost is just going to be too high. But since
                        people will rather protest and overthrow the constitution than starve to death, there
                        will be no other option than to implement UBI in all sovereign countries of the world.
                        Today&rsquo;s politics makes it brutal for poor countries that will have to deal with
                        heavy unemployment rates due to automation. The poorer a nation, the more challenging it
                        is going to be for it to provide basic income to its citizens. To solve this, many have
                        even advocated for a one planet government that is one constitution and one nation for
                        the world world. This would massively simplify the politics of the world but it is going
                        to be very difficult to overthrow the previous power positions. Nobody in their right
                        mind thinks that one planet government is going to be a reality soon. &nbsp;So it is
                        going to be imperative for countries to start focusing on how to decrease their
                        population quickly before mass unemployment due to automation sets in. And the
                        automation this time is a lot different than in the past. This time it is not going to
                        take over the blue collar jobs, but it is&nbsp;first&nbsp;going to take over the white
                        color jobs which is something nobody could have predicted.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c21"></a>Worker friendly jobs</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since traditional jobs will be fully automated using advanced robots
                        infused with highly advanced cognitive intelligence, new worker friendly jobs will
                        arrive on the market. Jobs that traditionally didn&rsquo;t add to the economy and thus
                        didn&rsquo;t exist at all. These jobs are now going to pop up for the first time when
                        the world gains abundance. In an abundant world where there is no scarcity of resources
                        and food but scarcity of meaning and satisfaction, people who are now useless will
                        engage themselves with other people in various activities to derive pleasure and
                        satisfaction from that.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These jobs include emotional bonding, talking, giving company,
                        drinking together, sleeping together, hanging out together, making love together with
                        consent etc. Basically all the human-human interaction jobs. Since robots would have
                        taken over factories and offices and even houses where they would automatically make
                        food and perform chores for the home owners, humans would only have other humans to get
                        a moment away from fully automated existence.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Worker friendly jobs are a necessary thing to think about. When it
                        comes to tireless lives many people live, they often feel miserable and soulless. The
                        human brain desires something else. It desires emotional bonding, more intimate
                        relationships, better connection with the surrounding and deeper attachment with what it
                        likes. Today, with the machine-like lives many people are living, this part of human
                        requirement has been chopped off from the slate. Worker-friendly jobs, if they exist in
                        the future, are supposed to bring back this vitality among workers. The traditional
                        concept of a worker being somebody working 8 to 10 hour shifts inside a factory to earn
                        money will be outdated once automation takes away those boring jobs. The worker friendly
                        jobs will take these jobs the machines can pull off and replace them with themselves.
                        These new jobs will be only about the worker. Traditionally, workers worked for others
                        but now workers work for themselves and don&rsquo;t even need to get paid money because
                        in such a society, every demand will be fulfilled on a requirement basis with a leeway
                        for extra spending of saved credits. These credits may be earned or collected for the
                        future. Everyday, a fixed amount of credit will be deposited on every worker&rsquo;s
                        account. The value the workers are bringing to themselves will earn them more credits.
                        You may or may not view these credits as traditional money.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c22"></a>Mindset change</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mindset about traditional work will start to change as the world
                        becomes more and more abundant. This mindset change will be in regards to hourly pay
                        jobs, worker rights, union etc. The general mindset will shift towards some form of UBI.
                        The various nations of the world will start to become equally prosperous and will gain
                        equal foot holding on making global policies related decisions. Since no country would
                        be lagging behind any other country, humans will all be culturally modern. Modern
                        culture would thus infuse every person&rsquo;s brain. This change in mindset will be the
                        biggest in human history. Humans would finally become more compassionate, more literate
                        and more altruistic. EA would be implemented on all corners of the world. And with EA
                        flawlessly implemented, no human would ever suffer due to inaccessibility to basic human
                        needs. After that, UBI will elevate everybody&rsquo;s living standards.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the mindset of the public to change however, there is going to be
                        a need for the zeitgeist to change. First of all, it must get revamped. Current mindset
                        among various underdeveloped countries especially India and other asian countries is as
                        follows:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>The fundamental duty of a kid is to study hard after which she must get enrolled
                                in a prestigious university to continue her higher studies.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Then after completing her higher studies, she must be ready to get a job. If the
                                job is governmental, even better. Alternatively, if she is a girl in India, she
                                must be ready to get married to a good boy.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Marriage is the thing that every young generation must take seriously. In India,
                                one must marry the perfectly arranged partner by the parents.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The current trend in India is that individuals should be more
                        concerned about their job and marriage rather than exploring one&rsquo;s passion. Rich
                        middle class families suffer from this problem. Imagine lower class families. We will
                        talk about them now. Here is the mindset of lower class families in various
                        underdeveloped states of India like Bihar and UP:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>One must marry before the age of 19.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Girls must get married as soon as possible. She must then give birth to kids in
                                order to continue the ancestry descent.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Girls don&rsquo;t need education if their husband is already in the process of
                                studying or has finished studying.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Girls must respect their husband and his family.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The husband must take a dowry before finalizing the marriage. If the dowry is
                                insufficient, the marriage will be scrapped.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These mindsets set back the progress of a society. Thus it is
                        necessary to change the mindset of the public. If the mindset remains the same, the
                        society or the community will never develop.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c23"></a>How UBI will be implemented</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UBI is difficult to implement flawlessly. To implement it in EA
                        fashion, one will need to consider equity and equality factors. If one part of a nation
                        is underdeveloped and more poor than other regions then the federal UBI budget should be
                        prioritized in that region. This is contrary to the school of philosophy that believes
                        UBI should be distributed equally. UBI according to me should not be distributed equally
                        because that would inflate prices massively. Even if the producers of products are
                        advanced robots, in a capitalistic world, display of greed from the top executives will
                        drive prices up no matter what. For that some form of restricted capitalist economy
                        should be implemented. Like no owner should be allowed to drive their products&rsquo;
                        prices up unconditionally. Like there must be a reason for every hike in price. Taking
                        away ownership would take away capitalism itself which is the foundation of modern
                        Europe and America&rsquo;s free market. One must be very diligent as to not get rid of
                        &nbsp;capitalism itself when trying to curb its power just like not throwing the baby
                        with the bathwater.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Capitalism will never be perfect which is why one must try to improve
                        it by using more technology and improving its basic tenets. The perfect enactment of UBI
                        will never happen. The problems will be the same as charity which will require EA for
                        effective solutions. We talk about EA and the problems today&rsquo;s charities face in
                        chapter 2. So, UBI is something like charity. Today charities face various problems.
                        These problems, UBI will also face when it is implemented. Let&rsquo;s list the problems
                        here:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>How to distribute UBI? Equally or based on equity. Should it be merit based or
                                completely impartial?&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>How will UBI be calibrated for different states? Will rich states get more UBI
                                funding or an equal amount?&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>How will businesses sustain themselves when the corporate tax is dramatically
                                increased to provide the money for UBI? How will they pay for robots if robots
                                are the reason the tax is increased?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Will robots be free for businesses to buy from the government if the government
                                raises taxes for businesses possessing robots?</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s look at problem no 1. How to distribute UBI? Well, first
                        of all, if cannot be completely impartial. There must be some merit. If everybody earns
                        equally then nobody will care to do anything different and that will stagnate economic
                        growth. If somebody asks tax credits from the government to work on some project and his
                        UBI is dramatically increased to fund his venture, then that will create an imperative
                        for other people to follow that. Thus, UBI should be based on merit and must not be
                        equally given.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s look at problem no 2. How will UBI be allocated to rich
                        and poor states? To understand this problem, let&rsquo;s understand how cities can be
                        rich and poor. People when they migrate from low income cities to high income cities,
                        they do so in search of better market prices, better pay, better business growth
                        potential etc. That automatically makes the destination city richer and the original
                        city poorer. On top of that, if a city spends more money than necessary on liabilities
                        instead of funding businesses, like maintenance of the drinking water system, sewage
                        management, housing etc. Thus it is alright for cities to be worth different. When UBI
                        is enacted though, how will rich cities spend the excess money that the other cities
                        lack? The problem is that when one city gives a greater amount of UBI to its citizens,
                        the citizens will flood that city, open businesses there and further increase the
                        city&rsquo;s worth. This cycle if let to go on without being stopped, then the rich-poor
                        divide will increase even further. People are petty creatures. If they see somebody
                        getting more than they are getting then that will cause them uneasiness. That&rsquo;s
                        how humans have been since time immemorial. Humans can&rsquo;t stand the other getting
                        more than them. To solve this, effective migration policies will have to be implemented.
                        That is against the policies of a free nation however. Democracy doesn&rsquo;t have the
                        power to limit the freedom of movement of its citizens. The citizens have the right to
                        do whatever in search of opportunity, if implementing UBI means confiscating that right
                        from the citizens then so much for UBI. No new policy will be more powerful than
                        existing rights inscribed in the constitution.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s now look at problem no 3. How will businesses with
                        increased taxation rates prevent themselves from going bankrupt? Businesses have a
                        safety channel which prevents them from going bankrupt. They aren&rsquo;t linked to an
                        individual. They are classified as something called limited liability company or private
                        limited. These categories help the business in question to operate with the benefit of
                        law protection, various subsidies and so on. So, when UBI is implemented, the various
                        forms of subsidies will be increased to help small businesses grow and their tax rates
                        will be at minimum while large corporations that are using robots will have their
                        taxation rates fixed at quite high.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The last question is abit of a scrupulous question. It is asking that
                        if the government is penalizing businesses using robots by asking more tax from them, is
                        it trying to say stop progress? Aren&rsquo;t robots just machines? If so then when
                        computers removed calculation women from their job, why weren&rsquo;t businesses using
                        computers penalized? What is so different this time? The questions start to get
                        rhetorical after a while so the gist here is why implement these policies at all? Why
                        not just let things take their natural course? This is to be seen. What the world will
                        actually look like when robots take over majority of jobs of the economy is yet to be
                        seen. Whether or not these policies will actually be enforced is still unknown. However,
                        it looks like things are different this time.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c24"></a>The arrival of utopia</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Capitalism has surely brought a lot of freedom and choice to the
                        customer. TVs, fridges, cars and air conditioners, none of them would have been possible
                        in the Soviet union. Only in a capitalist economy where entrepreneurs are willing to
                        invest their time and capital are fridges and phones a reality. Humans are not
                        intelligent enough to run a centralized economy no matter the size of the central ruling
                        committee.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, with this pace, are we going to finally achieve utopia in the
                        near future? It certainly looks like we will but one can never be sure. One can be sure
                        about only one thing in life. That change is the only constant.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c25"></a>A story of a utopian civilization</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The story begins with a boy named Bora. He is on an adventure to
                        discover the lost relic of a hidden ocean civilization. The civilization referred to as
                        the lost city of Atlantia is thought to have existed between 50000 years ago to 45000
                        years ago, long before the pyramids. If such an advanced civilization existed such a
                        long time ago then the history books would have to change their writings to reflect the
                        truth.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bora was on his way to enter a hidden cave in the middle of a
                        jungle. The cave was dark and so he was afraid to enter it alone. He saw that deep down
                        the cave, there was something shiny. Although he couldn&rsquo;t make it out with his
                        naked eyes, he was certain that he could reach there and see it up close. He brought
                        some gear with him that would assist him during the descent. He was nervous but slowly
                        he hooked some pins into the ground and tied knots in them. After attaching himself to
                        the cable hook, he gathered some courage and started descending through the cave. He
                        reached the bottom after half an hour. After being suspended for such a long time, he
                        was feeling extreme fatigue. He laid down for some moments after touching the ground.
                        All was well, but it didn&rsquo;t make sense to Bora as to why a relic of a civilization
                        that existed 50000 years ago was something he wanted to find. Maybe it was his curiosity
                        as to how the ancients lived or as to what technologies even though much primitive than
                        his era they possessed. So he got determined once again and started to trace out paths
                        that he would take for searching the underground monument. After just a few hours of
                        searching through the vast cave, he found something he couldn&rsquo;t believe. He found
                        a sheer silvery box that was as smooth as a zero tolerance machined cube and had
                        intricate patterns carved all over it. He thought they were just engravings but upon
                        closer inspection, he found out that they were wirings of electricity that extended all
                        around the box. This made him lose his breath. He leaped off the ground and took several
                        photographs. It was something much more than what he expected to find in that cave. The
                        lost city of Atalantia wasn&rsquo;t any primitive civilization, it was a civilization
                        that was 50000 years ahead of humanity but it somehow got destroyed in some calamity.
                        Bora was now worried that this calamity could also hit humanity and make them go extinct
                        and only leave relics behind.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bora climbed back up the cave and took fresh air after a long time.
                        He was now determined to share his findings with everybody. Just then the simulation
                        ended and Bora woke up from his dream VR simulation protocol. All of what he just
                        experienced was projected into his brain and was completely fabricated. This was the
                        daily ritual of the people living in 2080. The world was completely operated by robots
                        and people didn&rsquo;t have anything else to do other than to immerse themselves in
                        virtual reality games and spend hours in them. The game that Bora just played was called
                        the lost city of Atlantia deluxe edition. Deluxe meant the environments were more
                        detailed. This game was one of several that the inhabitants of the world in 2080 played.

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c26"></a>Why the world looks static but is changing rapidly</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the far future of intelligence? As far as one can tell, the
                        future will be better than today obviously but there will be certain differences geo
                        politically and culturally between the world of today and tomorrow. These differences
                        make up the bulk of the transition difficulty for today&rsquo;s world and tomorrow. One
                        can however take a leap of faith and trust that the world of tomorrow will provide them
                        far more opportunities to explore various emotions and self better than today.
                        Understanding oneself is the only path of enlightenment. Noone can teach you to become
                        somebody. You have the power to do that yourself and it takes time. If earlier in your
                        life or your childhood, you weren&rsquo;t taught to write or study, it will be damn near
                        impossible to learn that later. To prevent such mistakes from happening and basically
                        damaging one&rsquo;s entire life, governments give free education to their citizens or
                        at least the governments of the rich countries. More education definitely means better
                        chances for the development of a country and the better developed a country is, the
                        better the mindset of people that exist in it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The reason why I brought up the point about education is because it
                        is something really important. A hundred years ago today, education was a luxury. You
                        had to be rich to get a decent education. But in that era, education didn&rsquo;t really
                        matter that much. Education plays a vital role today because language, trade, knowledge,
                        communication all fall under it. Without these vital human characteristics, one cannot
                        become a good and successful person.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The benefits of a free and good education will be started later on in
                        this book. Till then I want to finish this chapter with a note on why the singularity is
                        extremely necessary for the psychological well being of humans. I will explain why it
                        will be devastating if for some reasons it never arrives. This is an important note to
                        end this chapter with. There is nothing that&rsquo;s going to be more consequential in
                        this world than the singularity. Singularity is the one thing that will end everything.
                        Everything that you ever imagined is going to be irreversibly changed by the arrival of
                        singularity. Ok, since I made this point with such conviction, let me also prove it in
                        the next section. The whole book revolves around the premise of the singularity coming.
                        If this one point isn&rsquo;t made clear then nothing will be made clear.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, why does the world look like no progress is happening at all? The
                        economy of the world is dependent upon the premise that the economic pie increases. The
                        economic pie isn&rsquo;t certain to increase. One must push it to increase its size. To
                        push an economy, businesses need to be conducted. Businesses are different from
                        revolutionary startups that require entrepreneurial aptitude. A simple shopkeeper
                        putting up a shop in the middle of a village is no more or no less businessman than a
                        supermarket chain owner. Both are doing business in this case. But if a kid born in the
                        middle of nowhere suddenly comes up with a vision and that vision is sufficient to find
                        a new market and change the market dynamics to increase demand for a whole new category
                        of product then that kid is an entrepreneur. One has to develop the skill of
                        entrepreneurship. Without it, the economic size of the world will not increase.
                        Let&rsquo;s ask the question: Why is entrepreneurship difficult?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To answer this question, let us state one important fact. It is
                        always difficult to think out of the box. That box can be anything. It can be about a
                        toothpaste market, it can be about a gym institute etcetera. If you develop a way to
                        break the norms and do something completely different than the ordinary then you become
                        an entrepreneur. For that, you need innovation. Innovation is a vast subject. It can
                        literally be about anything. Suppose you invent an idea to make the supply chain of
                        smartphone parts faster. You implement it and suddenly all of the smartphone
                        manufacturers, not just you increase their productivity. This boosts the economy
                        multiple folds than what would have happened if only your company employed that
                        brilliant idea. Ideas don&rsquo;t lose their value with sharing. If you can invent
                        anything, the patent, if you choose to patent your idea, is the product. Anybody with
                        the license to use your patent will use it and change their game. This is how the
                        economic playing field changes with time. Overtime, massive new ideas flood the market.
                        These ideas may be big and small but they all are new. These ideas are what change the
                        world, not any product or company or some industry. Ideas have the power to accelerate
                        the change of the world from a bare natural environment where biological creatures live
                        and interact to a powerhouse filled with ingenuity, creativity and growth. That growth
                        drives the economy, not any individual or an industry or something else.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The basic tenet of the singularity is that the transition from a
                        barren planet to that powerhouse is almost there. The last thing to happen will be the
                        final step to complete the transition. After the transition, the world will be fully and
                        radically different. It will remove all desperations, all sufferings and all the stains
                        that currently cover it everywhere. Political change is not enough to remove all the
                        sufferings in the world. There is still suffering that exists in the world even in the
                        age of the iPhone and free market. Why isn&rsquo;t the innovation that came before us
                        enough to give everybody the basic human requirements of food, shelter and clothing.
                        Still millions of people all around the world are suffering at the hands of the elements
                        of nature because the country or the state that they are living in isn&apos;t rich
                        enough to provide for them that. This is a failure on the part of humans. Animals still
                        go through a lot of suffering just to fill out plates with protein. Currently the source
                        of animal protein is meat. There have been advancements in cultured meat but people
                        haven&rsquo;t yet figured out how to mass produce it to fulfill the existing demand. Why
                        is a new innovation so difficult?</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This question comes back to us in the form of why the brainstorming
                        of a new idea is difficult in the first place? Humans have a malleable brain that, as
                        time passes by, stores new memories but cannot delete the past ones completely. This is
                        the design architecture that has been hardwired into it since the beginning. Our brains
                        cannot relearn anything at the core level. The human brain cannot rewire the already
                        hardwired pathways of the neurons in any meaningful manner. The only way to accomplish
                        adding new thoughts into the mind is by continuous and relentless practice. The saying,
                        practice makes man perfect isn&rsquo;t actually a bad saying. When one repeats an action
                        multiple times per day, the action basically gets engraved into the brain itself. The
                        only way to make oneself better at something is through hard work. If becoming an expert
                        was easier, then there wouldn&rsquo;t be so much trouble in the world to produce
                        skillful workers for the economy. This is why there are more fast food chain workers
                        than white collar jobs. It is simply too much effort to acquire a skill that is going
                        tot be useful for the economy. It can easily take more than 10 years for one to acquire
                        a valuable skill that is going to put a meaningful contribution into the world. For all
                        that time, instead of sitting idly, one can instead earn some side money through part
                        time jobs. This simultaneously gives them some money as well as helps the economy to
                        remain stable. This however doesn&rsquo;t not grow the already stable economy.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During times of depression, the country has to grapple with massive
                        disappointment from the public. This disappointment can completely cripple the
                        nation&rsquo;s foundation. This almost happened to America in the 1920&rsquo;s
                        depression. During that time, even in a rich and self-sufficient country like America,
                        people were going hungry and had to make their ends meet with barely sufficient
                        resources. Many even lost their homes. Almost all had their wealth reduced by around
                        70%. The middle class were the ones that suffered the most. They had the capital that
                        they put in the banks flowing into the stock market that was on the verge of crashing.
                        When that final crash happened abruptly, no one could get away safely from the sudden
                        disaster that gripped the whole nation.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So if economic depression is a problem every free capitalist nation
                        has to deal with once every century or so, what measures can they take to avoid the
                        disastrous effect of the event? There are several things the US did to quell the damage
                        that the downwards spiraling economy was doing to the nation. One thing was obviously
                        providing the people with food to eat. For the first time in America&apos;s history, one
                        could see long lines of people waiting outside ration distribution centers. This was
                        only seen in the soviet union. When the great nation of Germany fell, east Germany was
                        also the same. That part of the country had a centralized economy that couldn&rsquo;t
                        fulfill the basic demands of its citizens. People even in the 1980&rsquo;s had to wait
                        outside ration centers. Imagine that, even with the technology of the 80&rsquo;s, the
                        communist division of Germany couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to effectively supply food
                        to everybody&rsquo;s house. Any praise you hear about a socialist economy after that
                        should be thrown into the dustbin. This economy deserves not an iota of respect in its
                        current form. If new ideas are added that upgrades it so that while simultaneously
                        providing all the benefits of capitalism, it also reduces the rich-poor divide, then
                        that is a win-win for everybody.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Should we expect to get such a model of governance in the early 21st
                        century? It seems likely that with the advancements in artificial intelligence, the
                        world will be not governed by people but instead by machines. If this were to happen,
                        one can expect to see some form of a centralized economy instead of a free form
                        capitalism. It may also be possible to expect a restricted form of capitalism where the
                        restrictions are put in place by the AI. The AI however will need to be checked for
                        dealing with non optimal conditions. Since humans are hard to predict because of their
                        free will, which might or might not exist, any form of a general predictor might not be
                        completely able to foresee the interactions between billions of individual free thinking
                        humans in the economy.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is the change that has been in the kiln for long enough to be
                        finally brought into the world. This is the only change needed to fix the worst form of
                        rich-poor divide never before seen in the history of human civilization. Previously
                        kings and queens used to rule every nation, nowadays a better form of governance that is
                        democracy which is conducted by the citizens themselves has taken its place. Loving
                        one&rsquo;s country is also the foundation of democracy. If one doesn&rsquo;t believe in
                        his/her country&rsquo;s ability to improve then he/she will not vow to take part in the
                        thing that holds democracy in place that is the elections.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Elections are some of the most peculiar things that have been a part
                        of human culture. Every 4 years or so, people across a nation come together at a
                        designated place to take part in a popularity contest in which they cast their vote to
                        the contestant of their liking. The one who gets the most votes wins and takes his place
                        in the government even though he/she may not be qualified for the position. Due to this
                        reason, various nations have had to deal with leaders in top positions who are
                        absolutely undeserving of the post due to their lack of experience and qualifications.
                        This has led to democracy turning out to be the system that has the least probability of
                        being the best form of government.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c27"></a>Why the singularity is absolutely necessary for humanity</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s begin this section with a question. The question is
                        stated as follows: What invention in this world do you think was the most important
                        invention for the uplifting of the whole of humanity? The answers tend to oscillate
                        between the fire and the invention of electricity. Take fire for instance. Fire gave
                        warmth to hairless human ancestors for the first time ever and it marked the point in
                        time when humans were for the first time able to defend themselves from the fiercest
                        predators trying to eat them alive. If its invention was delayed even by some thousands
                        of years, it is likely that humanity would have gone extinct long before. Today with our
                        advanced thinking and technologies, we have a chance to not only colonize this solar
                        system but the entire galaxy. If we put some more ingenuity into the thinking we do then
                        there is a possibility that we will even be able to colonize the whole universe. We will
                        *talk about it extensively in the later parts of this book.* So, all in all, it will be
                        the biggest revolution if we are able to herald the singularity. The one thing that
                        humans are maybe capable of doing is waiting patiently for it. If we don&rsquo;t
                        actively try to stop it from coming then there seems to be no concrete reason as to why
                        it will not arrive at all.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Talking about the singularity, let&apos;s get to the point and say
                        why its arrival is so vital for society.&nbsp;</p>

                        go away&nbsp;</h2>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first many pages of this chapter will only be about problems and
                        nothing about the solutions to those problems. We will begin with a light tone and
                        consistently increase it to be a darker and scary tone in the later pages. What
                        I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish by doing this is getting you acquainted with all the
                        worst problems facing humanity step by step. I want to give you time to absorb how
                        difficult the situation we are in right now is. The problem will not be solved
                        automatically. To elevate human beings&rsquo; status in nature, we will have to work
                        harder and harder to deal with all the problems staring us in the face. But first we
                        must get well versed in them. So let&apos;s start. We will first talk about diseases.
                        Diseases will have their own subsections. Those subsections will be of various
                        individual diseases.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>*to be finished*</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c30"></a>Diseases</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the dawn of life till today, one thing has remained unchanged.
                        One form of life always tries to intrude on other forms of life. There is no sense of
                        private space in nature. A predator intrudes the resting place of its prey, a virus
                        invades the body of its host, a plant intrudes the resting place of another neighboring
                        plant etcetera etcetera. If the thing called private space existed in nature with actual
                        conviction, there would&rsquo;ve simply been no diseases that any life form had to deal
                        with. But since every life form is always competing with some other life form for
                        securing its position in the ecosystem&rsquo;s hierarchy, even the cells in your body
                        when they turn cancerous, we will talk about cancer later in much detail; there is a
                        disturbance that is created when it happens. Disease is simply the manifestation of that
                        disturbance. There is no disease in nature that is contracted with non life elements.
                        Yes there is chemical poisoning and injuries but if you exclude those two then it
                        becomes crystal clear that to solve diseases, one has to deal with biology not geology.
                        If through various research, in the future, humanity is able to get rid of almost all
                        forms of diseases then that will happen through intervention in the processes of
                        biology. Biology is a messy thing, there is no doubt. If there was a simple interface in
                        every biological body that when connected with a wire to a computer allowed engineers to
                        get rid of all the maladies present inside the body, then the problem would be solved in
                        an instant. But since there is no such interface in the human body that exists
                        naturally, scientists will have to first map out every minute part that is involved in
                        the functioning of the human body. Only then there is a chance that biological viruses
                        will be as easy to deal with as computer viruses. Remember, they look completely
                        different, but that is because right now there is no effective way to simulate or
                        &lsquo;run&rsquo;&nbsp;the biological virus in a sandbox testing software. This is an
                        issue concerning the digitization of the human body. If one day the human body is
                        completely digitized, the human body will be the same as a giant computer. The giant
                        computer will be able to be tested thoroughly in a virtual sandbox where all the
                        shortcomings and unintentional errors will be dealt with using various algorithms and
                        techniques. These algorithms and techniques will then be transferred to the actual
                        biological body where they will work just as intended thereby eradicating the problem or
                        infliction in the body.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These step by step methods of getting rid of diseases if the body
                        were to be a digital computer are well planned out in paper but nobody knows how
                        difficult the actual process of digitizing the messy biological body will be in reality.
                        So, right now we can only imagine this prospect and get ready for this type of medical
                        diagnosis and treatment. Current treatment methods of various diseases are messy and
                        filled with errors. So let&apos;s talk about the standard disease diagnosis and
                        treatment process of today.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c31"></a>Disease diagnosis and early treatment</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suppose you suffer from malaria. This isn&rsquo;t a problem in the
                        west but it is very common in undeveloped regions like India and African states. The
                        disease begins with the bite of a female innocuous mosquito that has already got
                        infected with the malaria virus. The virus then makes its way from the bite site through
                        the bloodstream spreading all across the body. The virus then begins a cycle of
                        infecting healthy cells, injecting its DNA into the cell&rsquo;s cytoplasm and churning
                        out multiple copies of it by taking advantage of the cell building machinery inside the
                        host. The host cell is completely helpless when it contracts the virus. The only hope it
                        has left is an ancient mechanism of bacteria called CRISPR that it has inherited. This
                        method tries to identify the foreign DNA strain and if it makes any correspondence with
                        a previous infection, it swiftly cuts the viral DNA &nbsp;away and regains its original
                        functionality. But this is a last ditch effort to resolve the matter, it is very likely
                        that this will fail completely and the virus hijacks the cell completely.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After this happens, the virus gathers momentum and spreads like
                        wildfire throughout the body. The infection turns into a disease. This disease manifests
                        various symptoms which can be recognized externally. These external indicators are the
                        first place anybody looks to identify if someone has fallen sick. This is a very
                        unreliable method of monitoring the body since by the time the symptoms appear, the
                        disease has already progressed into later stages which gets difficult to treat. If a
                        better monitoring method is kept in place to recognize an infection, there would be a
                        much higher chance of complete recovery from the sickness. Right now serious diseases
                        like cancer avoid early monitoring by showing no symptoms and silently advance into
                        later stages which gets impossible to recover back from.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Treatment will begin as soon as the infected person is taken to the
                        hospital. Most hospitals use various unreliable tests like blood tests and urine tests
                        to measure the composition of the body fluids in an attempt to pinpoint the disease.
                        When they think that they have found the likely culprit, they begin administering
                        various drugs into the body. The problem is the drugs themselves are imperfect. Most of
                        the drugs that are used to treat illnesses are derived from clinical trials where they
                        are tested on a group of sick individuals to find out if the cure works. This process
                        called clinical testing is very imperfect and to make it better, another 50% is given
                        placebo to make sure that the mere action of taking a fake medicine is not producing any
                        result.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s say the doctors administer some malaria drugs that can be
                        ingested. The recovery phase starts to take place within a day of taking the medicines.
                        The recovery process is not easy but is also not left to natural progression. If malaria
                        is allowed to wreck all the havoc it can wreck in a body, then the likely outcome of
                        such a serious illness is death. Here death is a result of either no consumption of
                        medicines and if medicine are taken then due to ineffective treatment methods.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ineffective treatment methods exist everywhere in the healthcare
                        field. There is no disease that has the perfect treatment available. All treatments work
                        on a hit or miss basis with variable range of outcomes for different cases. Now this is
                        the problem with biology. Since it is incredibly messy, there is no guarantee that a
                        life threatening disease will be cured. There is always a possibility that a person will
                        die of a mild common cold due to it advancing too much dangerous phase. This is exactly
                        what happened with covid. Covid is just like a common cold in its symptoms during early
                        phase but as it advances to later phase, the disease manifests symptoms that get harder
                        and harder to deal with. In covid, the outcome is death when many organs inside the body
                        fail and sends the patient into a septic shock. Septic shock is very common in seriously
                        bedridden patients who got a virus spread throughout the body.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why is finding new treatments so difficult? It is not because there
                        are none. If you can theoretically imagine any possible way to treat a disease, however
                        dangerous, if you are then able to carry out the thought process perfectly then there is
                        no reason for why that treatment would not work. Remember diseases are fundamentally a
                        biological phenomenon. They are the principal cause of the very common long term chronic
                        suffering that many humans experience.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c32"></a>The story of Covid</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ever since the dawn of the stone age, humans have been developing
                        solutions to the problems they face using their ingenuity. The primary methods of
                        finding a solution to some complication includes brute forcing, reasoning thoughtfully
                        about the problem, working backwards, shortcutting, deleting parts, adding parts etc.
                        The first two are widely used in the medical field. Whenever a new virus or a pathogen
                        arises, researchers and lab technicians work furiously to develop some cure to the
                        pathogen. The cure often crops up when the researchers try various methods to make their
                        headway through the problem. So for example when the SARS Cov 2 virus transpired,
                        scientists tried various ways to build the vaccine but the working method was to inject
                        various strains of Cov 2 vaccines in animals to see which worked and which didn&rsquo;t.
                        This helped them to make a shortlist of the working preliminary vaccines which helped
                        them to further refine the vaccine. The final vaccine came about when an mRNA strain
                        proved to be the most efficacious for dealing with the deadly lung virus. That turned
                        the heads of all scientists towards manufacturing more mRNA samples believing that mRNA
                        vaccines were the answers. The whole world was startled when scientists were able to
                        come up with a vaccine in a record time of just 1 year. This unprecedented pace of
                        vaccine development was neve before seen in the history of pandemics. Nothing compares
                        to how fast research and innovation happened in vaccine science during the time of the
                        Covid pandemic. It was also the first time when mRNA vaccines were mass produced as a
                        cure to a pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since this is a modern example of how a vaccine is rapidly put out to
                        the world, let&apos;s look at the history of vaccines and understand how hard the
                        problem of finding a vaccine is unlike how the Covid vaccine development story makes us
                        believe.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c33"></a>The traditional method of finding a vaccine</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The traditional method of finding a vaccine is sluggish. The few
                        methods that people knew about in the past for making a vaccine was killing the original
                        viral strain and injecting the dead strain into the patient&rsquo;s body, taking the
                        viral strain and injecting it into animals like pigs and horses to treat the patient by
                        transfusing the blood plasma of the animal into their body. This method was pioneered by
                        the scientist Jean-Baptiste Denis in 1667 when he transfused the blood from an animal to
                        King Louis XIV. Since then, many have performed the technique for various illnesses.
                        This is not really the type of thing we consider vaccine nowadays but the function is
                        the same. Both of them provide immunity from the disease by producing antigens inside
                        the victim&rsquo;s body.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another way to create a vaccine is to kill the virus and inject the
                        dead fragments into the body of the patient. What happens after this is that the DNA
                        encasing body of the virus activates various pathways in the immune system which
                        kickstarts the antigen formation process. This accelerates the production of specific
                        antibodies that are able to neutralize the virus infected cells to stop the growth of
                        the virus. All in all, this method is able to produce high quality vaccines that work as
                        expected for some viruses while completely failing to show the desired result for other
                        strains. This method is very powerful and the famous Rabies vaccine by Louis Psteur was
                        prepared this way. This is an amazing addition to the arsenal of medical scientists to
                        better equip humanity to deal with life threatening pathogens. So, if this method works
                        for some viruses while failing to work for other viruses, then what are the other
                        methods for finding a vaccine? Remember vaccines are a prevention medicine. It is not a
                        treatment. Sometimes it can work as a treatment if the incubation period of a particular
                        pathogen is long. For viruses that have a shorter time before symptoms arise, vaccines
                        are completely useless. Vaccines themselves need a kick off period. They don&rsquo;t
                        start producing antigens immediately. On top of that, vaccines are very difficult to
                        make. If making a vaccine was so easy, HIV would have been eradicated from the face of
                        the Earth just like Smallpox. The triumph of humanity over Smallpox is something to mark
                        in the history books. For the first time in history, humanity wiped out a purely
                        trouble-causing organism, if they can be called so, from the face of the Earth. It is a
                        great victory considering how much suffering the lifeless virus induced upon poor humans
                        that got infected by it. This however is one lucky roll in a thousand throws. We are not
                        that lucky with other viruses and pathogens. They still haunt us. If we are able to
                        purge all the viruses that exist today, we can live happily forever. That isn&rsquo;t
                        going to happen however since it takes on average 5 to 10 years to develop an effective
                        vaccine for the pathogens that can be vaccinated against. There are many that
                        don&rsquo;t have that characteristic. Surely in the future, that will become a reality.
                        It may be something that we handover to our AI machines to do. Till that day comes
                        however, we will have to worry about facing that next deadly pandemic looming ahead of
                        us.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The question arises then, if finding a vaccine is so difficult then
                        how on earth was a vaccine so nimbly made for SARS 2. Remember, this is very peculiar
                        since never have we developed a mass produced vaccine in under 1 year. We will talk
                        about that in the section below.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c34"></a>The modern method of finding a vaccine</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the covid virus infected its first victims in Wuhan China,
                        nobody had any inkling that this would turn into a world wide pandemic on the scale of
                        the great Spanish flu of 1918. Previously the SARS Cov 1 virus which affected around
                        8000 in 2004 was considered a major risk. It was more deadly and transmitted even more
                        easily than Cov 2. When it subsided and wasn&rsquo;t able to spread further, many became
                        complacent that another strain of the virus was unlikely to spread too. This complacency
                        brought the world to its knees when in the whole year of 2020, the entire world
                        completely shut down. The economy completely stopped and markets were not seeing any new
                        products other than masks. Major supply chains were interrupted by the disruption
                        brought by the virus and people in some parts of the globe starved. Lockdowns became the
                        common method employed by governments to restrain the spread of the virus. During
                        lockdowns, rations were provided by local municipalities to various communities. These
                        rations served as the only available food for many families.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c35"></a>A reason to worry</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The world right now has finite destinations. If you want to visit
                        somewhere then there are no infinite places. If you live in one place then later on you
                        decide to shift somewhere else, it is going to be very difficult. The housing market is
                        a very imposing one. It is designed to restrict one&rsquo;s freedom. Once you start
                        living at a place by building your own home, you will be bound to that place unless you
                        are ready to take some big actions by selling your house on the market. Let&rsquo;s look
                        at this with a detailed exposition of an example.</p>

                    <p>You buy a house. The house is located in a villa on top of a mountain. The house will
                        serve you if you like living on top of a mountain. One day surely, you are going to hate
                        the idea of living on top of a mountain and would wish to get fresh air off a beach. For
                        that you will need to find a prospective buyer of your mansion and convince him/her of
                        the reasons why the place is good. Real estate market is a market based on
                        persuasion.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Living in the same place forever is going to suck for sure. Nobody
                        likes that. Just think about where you are living right now. Do you want to live there
                        forever? What is the reason for that? Reason for both if you want to live there or if
                        you want to leave there.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s discuss why living in the same place for an extended
                        period of time is a bad thing. It is certainly bad. Here are the reasons:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>It takes away the ability of a person to build new memories: New memories are
                                what make a person into what he/she needs to be in life. Suppose you had to stay
                                in the same house since your childhood. Imagine that. For the longest time, you
                                will have no choice but to stay in that same house. Live the same memories. Look
                                at the same things. Do nothing new in your whole life. Talk about the same
                                things.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It takes away a person&rsquo;s creative ability: When one stays in the same place
                                for a long time like many people did during the extended lockdowns during covid
                                in 2020, the inspiration process goes away for them. This inspiration process is
                                vital if one wants to engage in some creative job. That can be anything like
                                writing, singing, composing etc. If you don&apos;t experience new things then
                                that creative process gets impaired.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It makes it difficult to stay focused and organized: This is true. When one
                                isn&rsquo;t able to interact with the surroundings other than in his/her
                                vicinity, then the part of his/her brain that has developed since the beginning
                                for making new visualizations and mappings will not be in its optimal state.
                                Remember the brain is a wet hardware and the patterns of neurons in a way
                                constitute the software of the brain. But the brain is a lot different than a
                                mere computer hardware.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>One&rsquo;s whole world view gets centered into only that place: If you live
                                seeing dinosaurs then getting transported into the jurassic era seeing those
                                dinosaurs again in their habitat, you will feel completely normal. Your world
                                view has been constructed by seeing those dinosaurs so the Jurassic era for you
                                will feel completely normal. This is how the brain works. It gets adapted to
                                whatever it has experienced for a long time. It is not possible to terminate a
                                long time memory of someone to inject a new memory in place of it. The neurons
                                themselves become the memories. Memories make one one. &nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c36"></a>The long awaited moment</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Never in the history of mankind has this one thing been absolutely
                        clear. Humans are driven by the imperative of doing good. Externally every human may be
                        different internally, if one were to inspect their inner feelings, they would know for
                        certain that they want to do good for humanity. Humanity is right now on the cusp of do
                        or die. What is so serious about humanity at this moment? Firstly, the thing that looks
                        like it isn&rsquo;t going so smoothly for humanity is the problem of social anonymity.
                        We talked about this in the first section of the first chapter. Social anonymity is a
                        big problem when it is given more power than it should have. This thing can easily turn
                        dangerous if not kept in check. The example we gave in the first chapter about social
                        anonymity clearly illustrates its problems. Now, let&rsquo;s make it even more crystal
                        clear. The main thing to consider about anonymity is that it has two sides just like any
                        scientific technology. Just like any invention in human history, say fire for example,
                        anonymity has some advantages and some disadvantages. Let&rsquo;s look at the advantages
                        first and then talk about the disadvantages and see how they have the power to destroy
                        human civilization.</p>

                    <p>Advantages:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Anonymity gives one the ability to hide their identity which can protect them
                                from online scrutiny.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Anonymity gives one the encouragement to post esoteric ideas without worrying
                                about being dabbed by society.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Anonymity works in the favor of the individuals that have the talent to do
                                things, change things and add things to the world but are too introverted to
                                reveal themselves in full while doing so.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Social media sites can utilize the process of anonymity to help flourish large
                                groups driven by goals inclined with the philosophy of anonymous society.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Large anonymously formed groups can grow to have power to alter the
                                society&rsquo;s thinking on important matters concerning the zeitgeist.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Disadvantages:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Anonymity gives one the total freedom to do whatever on the internet without
                                bearing the consequences in real life.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It allows oneself to have a greater sense of his/her worth or value than
                                what&rsquo;s actually real.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>That greater value inducement reduces the authenticity of the conversation
                                carried out by that individual.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Law enforcement and blame for one&rsquo;s actions will be completely useless if
                                the individual commits crimes anonymously.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>


                    <p>What is the long awaited moment that the title of this section implies. Well it&apos;s
                        just this. Once the world witnesses some form of digital renaissance, the problems that
                        concern it right now will be eradicated. The common view of many people would be that
                        once the world gets more and more digital, the problems that plague the digital mediums
                        such as the internet will get even worse and that will cause major issues in the world.
                        This is the opposite of what will happen. The reason they put in its favor is the common
                        one. These reasons are completely based on emotions. When you analyze the world through
                        the lens of a scientist or a rational predictor, the vision of the future comes together
                        like a droplet of water on a leaf. Good prediction of the future requires the skill to
                        see the world in an optimistic way first. Rational way comes second. If you aren&rsquo;t
                        optimist then the world will look like it is moving backwards. Like Trump&rsquo;s
                        slogan: Make America great again, the pessimistic way to look at the world is by saying
                        that the past is better than today which is surely not the case. The past was horrible,
                        there is no doubt about that. Most nations in the past were run by dictators. The
                        dictators didn&rsquo;t care an iota about the people. The people suffered as a result.
                        To make sure that this did not repeat again in the future, various nations in Europe and
                        America formed coalitions. The past democracies that were threatened by once democratic
                        turned autocratic nations like Germany and Italy, now became ever more powerful by
                        making their resolution clearer than ever. The constitution, however old, was
                        implemented on the basis of doing good to the people. This philosophy called humanism
                        was adopted dearly and resolutely by the governments in the latter half of 20th century.
                        The climax was when no one knows but it may have peaked its vision during the peaceful
                        non covid presidential era of Barack Obama. Obama was the first black president of
                        America. This unimagined prospect when it came true shocked the whole world. A black
                        person becoming the most powerful person of not just America but by extension the whole
                        world but then from a nation which had a past history of extreme racism and bigotry
                        against blacks, meant that nothing was impossible not just scientifically which was
                        proved by the renaissance but also politically. Politics is a broad thing. It brings
                        consequences for generations. Therefore when Obama became the first black president, it
                        wasn&rsquo;t long enough after that when America got its first black vice president.
                        This meant that not just the politics has changed due to Obama but the entire culture of
                        the nation. What&rsquo;s even better is that since the US is such a powerful nation that
                        has influence in art, fashion and social zeitgeist, it has the ability to change the
                        whole culture of the world. The power of ideas is such that they transcend boundaries of
                        nations dn reach everywhere reachable even the space station which now has many blacks
                        traveling to and fro it. That means that if humans were to colonize other planets, the
                        Earth and those planets would have power to influence each other in all ways possible.
                        This is how the world works. One part of the world, if it gathers momentum in any area,
                        that gets spread through all the corners of the world.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c37"></a>The problem with the past</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The civil service sector is extremely slow when it comes to getting
                        things done. In the past, there was a problem with landed gentry. With the emergence of
                        the patronage model, many more people were involved in the civil process.. That is the
                        person that came in charge of the new government or an authoritative institution came
                        through inheritance. Nepotism is also a problem. The political process didn&rsquo;t
                        include many people in the past. Like landed gentry for example. This system formed from
                        the close relations model of existing people. Civil service came as the solution to the
                        problems that emerged with patronage. So, in civil service all the citizens could now be
                        involved in the authoritative class. Solving the past problem with new technology is not
                        a new thing but it follows that when a new model or device is introduced, it tends to
                        bring out even more dilemmas. These dilemmas become the new problem. The civil service
                        in no way is a perfect model. It has now become the barrier to innovation as we move on
                        towards reinventing the government model of the past with it. India is a prime example
                        of this. Let&rsquo;s look at the problems of civil service particularly in India:</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c38"></a>The problems with civil service:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Civil service in India consumes the most amount of government resources in paying
                                the employees. The employees themselves would not be the problem but there are
                                so many of them that they become a major issue. This is difficult to solve and
                                one must look into this in detail to get to know the issue closely.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Civil service is so arduous when it comes to selection of the candidates that no
                                matter how hard one tries to streamline it, in India, the massive population
                                becomes a barrier in &nbsp;selection. Therefore, selection becomes difficult.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The sector is rife with challenges. Nothing is efficient and everything consumes
                                massive resources when the same thing could have been done 10 times more
                                efficiently at a limited private company.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Civil service appointment exams in India are the most time consuming and
                                unnecessarily complicated things to exist in the whole nation. They are
                                conducted multiple times a year and run for one to two weeks and again later for
                                the interview section.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>There is no incentive for the employees in the civil sector to get things done
                                quickly like there is in the private sector. If your boss asks
                                you&nbsp;&lsquo;What did you get done this week?&rsquo;&nbsp;then you will have
                                no option but to speak exactly what you did in order to save your job. In the
                                civil sector, there is no one who can ask that question to you except the
                                district or supreme court according to your working sector,</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In the past, any form of cultural dissemination wasn&rsquo;t possible simply because
                        people sat at the same place for generations. This caused them to not have new visitors
                        to their place and information traveled only through mouth thereby making them unaware
                        of world events outside of their small village. The concept of the world may not even
                        have been present in their minds. They were isolated from the rest of the planet so for
                        them the world constituted only their small community or village. This is how they
                        lived. They only cared about the things at their place and they didn&rsquo;t think much
                        about things other than their daily existence. They farmed, ate, slept and repeated this
                        cycle forever until they died and their children took their place. Slowly but surely the
                        villages grew in size because people gave birth to more than two children. This meant
                        over time, the population expanded and reached saturation levels. This meant the
                        villages had to expand and grow. Over time, the villages turned into large societies and
                        later through self reliance and independence turned into civilizations. The
                        civilizations were large so they needed some form of government and rule of law. Without
                        this, the civilizations collapsed and once again broke into separate uncooperative
                        villages. This is how governments came to be. The purpose of government was to act as a
                        structural support to keep a nation or a society in place. Previously governmental
                        affairs were handled by kings and their knights. Later on through developments in
                        philosophy and culture, the mindsets of people changed, people came together to form a
                        new type of government in which the kings and queens did not come into power through
                        inheritance. This happened for the first time in written history during the Roman
                        civilization. The Roman civilization had a governance system based on people&rsquo;s
                        electives. The people would choose and elect senators who would then act as the advisory
                        group to the king. This proved successful and Rome became the first civilization to have
                        a government that had a people&rsquo;s part. Democracy is the extension of this idea and
                        later on after almost 2 millenia, the majority of nations now host some form of
                        democracy. Democracy has become the least unsuccessful form of government. Yeah, there
                        are kings and queens today even in advanced democracies like the UAE and Bhutan, but
                        they have little importance in important matters. There are ministers chosen by people
                        for each sector of the economy, there are senators for each division of a country and so
                        on. In the UK, the role of king and queen is completely customary. They are irrelevant
                        on important matters and policy making. That is done by the prime minister and his
                        council.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, that being said, what does a government need in order to be
                        stable? First the government must be impartial in matters related to the public and
                        justice. When politics interferes in justice, the justice is doomed. Like the
                        song,&nbsp;&lsquo;And Justice for All&rsquo;&nbsp;by the American heavy metal band
                        Metallica said,&nbsp;</p>

                    <div style="text-align:center">
                        <i>&lsquo;Justice is lost, justice is raped<br></i>
                        <i>Justice is gone<br></i>
                        <i>Pulling your strings Justice is done<br></i>
                        <i>Seeking no truth winning is all<br></i>
                        <i>Find it so grim so true so real&rsquo;</i>
                    </div>

                    <p>justice can be really fickle. Without heavy impartiality from the side of the most
                        powerful organization of a nation, justice is doomed. When that happens, the public will
                        get angry. If one commits a crime but is close with the people in court, he/she will
                        take the advantage of that to get a bail. The same thing would be untrue for a small
                        middle class person. This discrimination builds up untrust and leads to public dismay.
                        If this continues to carry on, the public mob may rise to stir up a revolution. This is
                        not just the problem of the past but also a problem of the present and a serious one at
                        that. Today, in undeveloped regions where poverty is ubiquitous, people&rsquo;s mindset
                        carries the virus of corruption and bigotry. This virus is the heralder of doom. Even in
                        developed nations like America, mind virus is a problem. The more developed a region
                        gets, the more conscious the people try to become. Try is the keyword here. When they
                        try, they don&rsquo;t actually become conscious. They fall into a trap. They fall into a
                        trap of loose ends. They become hysterical about several things. They think that
                        everything is a problem when nothing is. This is obviously an issue. When there is a
                        mass of population that becomes hysterical about certain issues, that issue instead of
                        resolving becomes more problematic. Like the problem of racism. Racism was a non-issue
                        in the late 2010&rsquo;s due to the mindset change of people in America. But after the
                        election of Trump to the office, his radical right wing politics brought angst among
                        people that America was going to be a racist hell. Professors thinking themselves as the
                        front thinkers of society tried to build concepts and theories that would then be
                        implemented to bring better to the society. These concepts and theories enter into the
                        mainstream zeitgeist and if they are memetic, they enter into the mind of the public.

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c39"></a>The ability of technology to solve the problems of past</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who says technology can&rsquo;t solve problems. We have already got
                        many examples from the past where technology was used to great effect to solve problems.
                        This continues till today and will definitely continue into the future. Let&rsquo;s give
                        an example of that using the civil service sector again. Nowadays there are fingerprint
                        scanners in every civil service office to ensure the registration of the exact time of
                        arrival of the worker. This although not completely solved, has made the problem of
                        coming late to the workplace less of an issue. Websites, the bread and butter of the
                        web, they are what an evolved form of a new breakthrough looks like. Websites are in the
                        phase they are right now because of the innovation in the internet sector. Technology
                        has solved other problems in various sectors. The problem of data security, file
                        management, instant access, business scaling and everything else has become more and
                        more easier with the advent of better technologies. Technology drives human progress and
                        this is certainly truer than ever. Human progress is driven by the imperative to
                        improve. Improvement in any sector begins by some prospective revolutionaries trying to
                        do good for themselves. That then spreads to other sectors. This spreading of ideas and
                        mindset is what drives society&rsquo;s growth.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Technology can be regarded as the only thing that has got us out of
                        the stone age. The process of people thinking of making a tool for their individual
                        benefit in the stone age still continues to this day in the form of research,
                        development and science. Today, it is much more mature and big but the concept is the
                        same. People work to bring new ideas into the society which then grows the collective
                        mindset. That&rsquo;s how everything evolves, not just technology. Technology is just an
                        example.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c40"></a>A prelude to the book</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a non-fiction book which I wrote to prove one thing, that the
                        singularity as envisioned by Ray Kurzweil is going to undoubtedly arrive around the date
                        of 2045 AD. His original prediction of 2045 was so good that he kept it the same in his
                        following book to his first book,&nbsp;&lsquo;The singularity is
                        near.&rsquo;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s amazing is that the massive disruptions that happened to
                        the world between the release of the first book in 2005 and the second in 2023,
                        didn&rsquo;t alter the timeline of his predictions and the singularity wasn&rsquo;t
                        delayed, not even by a year. This book was written in 2022. I read the first book of
                        Kurzweil in 2020. Even after two years, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about what I
                        read. The book was so powerful to me that I couldn&rsquo;t grasp the implications of its
                        sentences even after rereading it for a 100th time. This is my favorite book ever. Even
                        if I read more books in the future, I&rsquo;m certain that none will beat this book. And
                        I&rsquo;m not saying that lightly. I have read more than 250 books both fiction and
                        non-fiction when I was the age of 18. Even if I got die after 80 more years which is
                        obviously not going to happen since the singularity would have arrived by then and all
                        of us would be digitally immortalized, I would still get the chance of reading 6500
                        books. To think that Kurzweil&rsquo;s writing would stand up to the much more
                        expositioning writings of 2070s and 2080s and of the last decade of my life, sounds
                        ridiculous. But it&rsquo;s not. Kurzweil&rsquo;s book is timeless. His writing
                        isn&rsquo;t of a domain or a technology. His writing writes the lines of the future
                        itself, of the technologies that are coming, how they are coming and what effect they
                        are going to bring to the world. The words in his book don&rsquo;t tell one story, they
                        tell a thousand stories of the past, present and the future. The book is his magnum opus
                        and thus is the culmination of his lifelong career. His work at MIT in the early 1960s
                        learning about computers that were bulky and slow doesn&rsquo;t look any less
                        consequential than a scientist working today at a server lab designing the next gen of
                        artificial minds with high tech compute chips. In both examples, they are working on the
                        next thing of tomorrow. Kurzweil brings that concept of continuous working towards the
                        next thing to the series of books he wrote. It is undoubtedly true that humans work on
                        getting the next thing out into the world. This is a game of living in the future and
                        trying to bring it by using the technologies of the present. If in the past, offices
                        used clerks to take attendance of employees, they were doing okay since they used the
                        most advanced technology of the time. But today, with the availability of embedded chips
                        and scanners, it is an oxymoron to bring a human into the fold.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The book is going to be a long one for sure but it is going to touch
                        a lot of fields. The work is all oriented towards the goal of proving that the
                        singularity will arrive in 2045. No sooner or later. But to prove it beyond any
                        reasonable doubt, it requires the utmost diligence on my part. The book was hard to
                        write but also fun at many times. When reading this book in 2030, it must feel like it
                        was ahead of its time. That the things written in it make sense completely. And when
                        this book is again read at around 2040, it must feel like it&rsquo;s trying to tell
                        something. Something big and hard to cast away as unimportant. Finally when reading the
                        book in 2045, it must be the book that will be regarded forever as the most important
                        companion book to Kurzweil&rsquo;s two books, one of 2005 and another of 2023. And both
                        of his books must be considered the most valuable books ever written. That is surely
                        going to happen since these two books literally tell what is going to happen to the
                        world in exquisite detail. This much detail in a book that&rsquo;s trying to tell the
                        future is unheard of. The author Kuzweil goes on to multiple long chains of reasonings
                        in each chapter trying to put together a story of the generations. The story of mankind
                        and their rise to the top of the universe itself. Starting from a humble muddy swamp,
                        mere biological creatures were able to expand to the distant edges of the cosmos using
                        the tools they created with their ingenuity. Tomorrow the process of creating new tools
                        will be handed over to the AI overlords but they are themselves a tool. Tool created by
                        humanity for humanity and to fulfill humanity&apos;s goal of filling the cosmos with
                        intelligence. Turning the dumb matter of the cosmos into computing substrates for
                        thinking. These thinking machines will think and construct. Endow self awareness into
                        all of the machines and amplify our current consciousness quadrillions and quadrillions
                        of fold. What will orgasm feel like after that? How extreme will it feel? Will one be
                        able to handle it? Machines will obviously be able to handle it since they are machines,
                        but a machine that is trillions and trillions of times more potent than a human body,
                        how will orgasm or any other extreme emotion feel like to them when they are amplified
                        to such levels. What would it feel like? Ponder this question when you go to sleep
                        tonight. To finally begin this book by writing the most important part, the part where
                        we go into detail about singularity, we will take a slight tangent and talk about
                        heartbreak.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c41"></a>Heartbreak</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heartbreak is something irresistible. It can arrive when something
                        you wish doesn&rsquo;t come true. A Kanye West song titled&nbsp;&lsquo;Heartless&rsquo;
                        perfectly&nbsp;describes how heartbreak feels like. In the world, there are many people,
                        all interacting with each other to benefit from the interactions. We can certainly say
                        without doubt that there is no one in the entire world who hasn&rsquo;t had a
                        heartbreak. Heartbreaks are common and they make one stronger. If you find yourself in a
                        difficult situation, then dissatisfaction and heartbreaks give you courage to get out of
                        the predicament. This is because heartbreaks act on your inner emotions to give rise to
                        emotions that are difficult to ignore. These emotions are very powerful and can change
                        one&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heartbreaks can be managed. There are effective ways to manage sad
                        feelings. Some common ways to manage heartbreaks are: loving yourself, understanding
                        yourself better, getting courage, becoming fearless and making plans. In life, there is
                        nothing certain, not even death. That saying of Churchill,&nbsp;&lsquo;Nothing is
                        certain in life except death and taxes&rsquo;&nbsp;is completely false. Developments in
                        age extension technologies are giving new hope towards the fight against death. Taxes on
                        the other hand looks like a good method to collect capital for the government but is
                        also going away along with death since the economy will no longer be capitalist. The
                        control of the government will transfer to advanced AIs and they will be the
                        representatives of authority. Some may not believe this is happening but it is. Oh it
                        is! You have to be ready for it so that you will not be taken by surprise.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c42"></a>Experimentation and innovation</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With this section, we are getting into the meat of this book. Up
                        until now, we didn&rsquo;t talk about singularity with much spotlight. Now the only
                        thing we will talk about going forward will be the singularity and its implications.
                        Let&rsquo;s talk about innovation since that is what turns the gears of progress of
                        human civilization. What is innovation? The most general thing about any evolutionary
                        process is improvement which comes in various ways. One of the most common ways
                        improvement happens is by systemic selection. When a natural organism is left free in
                        its habitat, it tends to adapt to the surroundings. This adaptation is a kind of
                        innovation. If the creature has not found any ways to adapt, meaning it hasn&rsquo;t
                        innovated a solution to the dilemma of survival or death, then it will not be able to
                        exist. This forces innovation in nature without a preliminary planning phase. There is
                        no phase in which the creature plans its next improvement. Life is a forceful agent. It
                        forces them to innovate. There is an optimistic way to look at the life and death
                        situation of animals in nature. Animals have no other way to innovate. The only way for
                        them to find a way to survive is through innovation. The implication is that if those
                        animals weren&rsquo;t allowed to innovate because they weren&rsquo;t forced to die if
                        they didn&rsquo;t innovate, humanity would have never evolved. The situation humanity
                        finds itself right now is the continuation of this dilemma. Animals have the instinct to
                        survive. This powerful impulse is a behavioral construct that is present in all the
                        living organisms. There is a dilemma in this. No organism, no matter how painful
                        existence it is bearing except a small percentage of intelligent humans, wants to die
                        because that is not something nature selected for them. This dilemma is so powerful that
                        still today with all the facilities humans get, they still are afraid about the chance
                        that the next room they live in has a predator that will eat them alive. Completely
                        irrational fear that emerges out of their limbic brain system. The limbic brain of
                        humans is an irrational part of the brain that completely fails to reason about the
                        present situation and fails to take appropriate actions.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So humans don&rsquo;t have freewill to choose their own fate, they
                        are forced to live and survive because they are fearful of death. Let&rsquo;s dive at
                        this sentence in much more detail to grasp its repercussions. First let&rsquo;s state
                        some undeniable truths about humans. They are as follows:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Humans don&rsquo;t have free will</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Humans are basically automatons but with emotions and feelings as vital additions. These
                        additions are important for their survival but not necessary. In the present state, they
                        are absolutely necessary for the working of the human machine but if since the inception
                        of time, animals evolved without the added baggage of emotions and feelings, they would
                        not be the part of today&rsquo;s biological organisms. There is some debate if this
                        reality allows for some freewill while also allowing for determinism. This concept is
                        the hardest to reconcile with the known physics because there is no law in physics that
                        allows for two completely different forces like determinism and free will that have no
                        link to each other to exist in the same reality. One day, maybe after a thousand years,
                        when scientists finally find the ultimate theory of everything, the question of whether
                        or not biological thinkers are free or not will get a compelling answer through the
                        scientific method.</p>

                    <ol start="2">
                        <li>
                            <p>The human body is a weak and pathetic machine</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The human body evolved. It wasn&rsquo;t designed with strength or durability in mind. It
                        just formed as a result of selection for survival. The body is a machine that works but
                        isn&rsquo;t going to withstand extreme forces that act upon it. It will withstand
                        injuries and that will cause the cells that make up the body to sustain long lasting
                        changes into the DNA itself. The DNA is the part of the cell that codes for all of the
                        individual components. The individual components that make up the cell perform various
                        operations, these operations constitute the systemic operation of the cell machinery.
                        The cell machinery handles all the vital processes. If just one part of the machinery
                        fails, it starts a chain reaction that corrupts the entire cell. This causes cell death
                        also known as apoptosis in scientific jargon. Harmful radiation permanently damages the
                        epidermis of skin. Continuous exposure to UV radiation causes changes in the DNA which
                        alters the coding mechanism of the cell. This leads to diseases related to genomic
                        alteration such as rapid cell growth and cancer.</p>

                    <ol start="3">
                        <li>
                            <p>Humans are emotional creatures</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Humans are way less rational and way more emotional. When it comes to taking a decision,
                        the human mind relies on past experiences and memories rather than a thoughtful
                        contemplation with their brain. This makes humans the worst animals when it comes to
                        taking the helm of important matters related to society and nation. Human emotions like
                        fear, hunger, sadness, loneliness, boredom, excitement etc. are the prime movers of a
                        human. A human is guided by his/her emotions and these emotions constitute the kind of
                        personality he/she will have. Emotions are very powerful, there is no question in that
                        but to say that emotions are the perfect way to continue a species into the next million
                        years is bullish. There must, without question, be infinite ways in this infinite
                        universe to evolve creatures that don&rsquo;t feel anything but survive and are selected
                        on the basis of their survivability in order to evolve better creatures in the
                        exploration space of all possible creatures.</p>

                    <ol start="4">
                        <li>
                            <p>Humans need a plethora of things to get satisfied</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The human mind isn&rsquo;t satisfied with one thing. It requires a diverse set of
                        emotional activities to get going. One cannot be in a state of perfect happiness however
                        hard he/she tries. Once you do something, next time you will note be satisfied with it.
                        Like a couple in a relationship, after staying together for a long time, the
                        relationship starts to fall apart from its seams. This is something unpreventable. Along
                        with food, shelter and clothes another important thing humans need to live a basic life
                        is a relationship that is deep. When that is lost, problems start to arise. Some rich
                        man buys a mega yacht and later on complains that the yacht is not to mark because the
                        ceiling is of different color while millions of kids in India are &nbsp;is just proof
                        that something has gone terribly wrong in this world. The way humans have gone boundless
                        in search of sheer luxury and unrestricted consumerism has produced a society
                        that&apos;s lacking in vision, reason and basic EA.</p>

                    <ol start="5">
                        <li>
                            <p>The gay complex:&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The traditional way of looking at relationships is very incomplete and lacking. To
                        understand what a relationship is, one must deep dive into the attraction complex. It is
                        not always true that the opposite sexes get attracted to each other. Sometimes, it just
                        so happens through circumstances that two people of the same gender get amazingly close
                        to each other which leads one of them to develop gay complex. What is gay complex?
                        Suppose two boys are in a same sex relationship. One of them is the dominant and another
                        is the subservient. The dominant employs various sex tactics such as anal, oral and
                        masturbation from the other side. This makes him the dominant one in the couple. The
                        other one, once subservient, always becomes a subservient after that. Human relations
                        are very complex and to say that this has been completely understood is an oxymoron.</p>

                    <ol start="6">
                        <li>
                            <p>Humans are petty:&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The human emotional complex is built up of various interlinking systems. It might be so
                        that when one gets upset or one is unhappy due to some circumstances, he/she will feel
                        petty and depressed. To take full advantage of the situation, one must act like he/she
                        is in the jungle. One must remove all petty emotions and find the ones that make him/her
                        a better personality. The kind of understanding mostly arrives when one finds a match of
                        his/her views in the other person. The other person either a girlfriend or boyfriend or
                        a gay friend or just an ordinary friend, all works fine to cheer up and give a kind of
                        value to the subject. This complex of a relationship works no matter what. It works in
                        any kind of situation. The same person who is very dislikable to one person can become
                        very likable and close to another person because of their thinking being alike. This is
                        an amazing fact and one must cherish it to get the better of it for themselves.</p>

                    <ol start="7">

                            <p>Humans need holy water:</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The titular water implies something other than drinking water. It is trying to say that
                        humans need a kind of inseparable component in their life. Something that makes them
                        complete. A world view for example. The reason so much of humanity believes in God is
                        because they put the concept of an omnipotent being above themselves. By doing so they
                        construct their image as something much more than a meat bag that originated in the
                        swamps. This view of the human origin is very disturbing to many which is why many
                        religions have their own origin story in which instead of putting humans as the same as
                        all creatures, they give special privilege to us hairless monkeys by stating that humans
                        came to this planet from a mythical God garden where we were made in the image of the
                        omnipotent God himself. This ridiculous sounding idea gained a lot of support in the
                        ancient times which led them to get a life of their own making them some of the biggest
                        memetic ideas ever. The idea of God is some of the most universal ideas in the entire
                        history of human civilization. It comes close to food, water, wife and house in terms of
                        word usage.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All these things that I stated are characteristics of humans because
                        humans are not designed. Many of these traits can be considered unwanted quirks in
                        modern fulfilled humans. Today, all our needs have been met and we can easily get what
                        we would die for a 1000 years ago. Even so, we are behaving irrationally and still have
                        the proclivities of an ape living on the branches of a tree in the middle of Savanna.
                        Through experimentation and innovation, we have made a lot of progress lately to get out
                        of the pitiful situation we were in the past. Today, with our wit and intelligence, we
                        control all the biosphere and bear the ability to destroy the entire globe with the
                        touch of a button. The crazy thing is that a hypothetical button can exist in the form
                        of some pixels on a touch screen nuclear control panel, it can also exist in the form of
                        an actual big red physical button sitting at the president&rsquo;s desk and also as a
                        voice operated command inside of a digital computer. This is the reach of our power. To
                        think that we have come from such humble beginnings to reach this moment is a poignant
                        thought.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c43"></a>Effective Altruism&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the most revolutionary philosophical movements in recent
                        history is EA which stands for Effective Altruism. We will explain this concept in
                        detail with an example. The example is a simple case of poverty and charity donation to
                        solve it.</p>
                    <p>The example:</p>
                    <p>Suppose in the middle of India, there is a family that is struggling to put two meals a
                        day on their table. The irony is that they don&rsquo;t have a table. They are so poor
                        that they rely on begged coins to buy rice which they then mix with water in the
                        following proportions: 2 cups water : 1 cup rice. This proportion is then put in a
                        cooking bowl which is placed on top of a log fire stove. They don&rsquo;t have enough
                        money for rigging up a real gas stove. They make do with the traditional Indian wooden
                        stove. The rice when cooking is mixed with some salt and is stirred continuously to
                        produce a viscous pudding that is then served onto the plates. This is the meal, every
                        day all year. Ok, so far so good. The family is able to survive on that. But here is the
                        bummer. There isn&rsquo;t enough money to send the 5 children in the small house to
                        school. Let&rsquo;s say this story is simultaneously happening across multiple villages
                        all over India. This is a really sad situation when you look at it. The majority of poor
                        Indian states suffer from this problem. There are many solutions to this problem, many
                        of them involve donations from NGOs and INGOs. However promising these methods look in
                        theory, in reality, the organizations suffer from the problem of management. The funds
                        that trickle from these charity organizations get mismanaged and go into places where
                        they aren&rsquo;t intended to. Suppose the most effective way to distribute the money is
                        by giving it to the most needed. This effective way is the standard way in theory. But
                        when it comes to practice, this becomes very difficult to implement. The most needed
                        become the most left behind. This happens because often the unwanted people come in
                        front of the line. They become unavoidable when giving away the funds. How does this
                        happen? Suppose a woman from a poor family represents the poverty in the house. She goes
                        to the local charity distribution center and asks for relief. The relief providers look
                        at her and give her the requisite money. Another person who is&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;10 times as rich as the lady comes to the center and is given a slightly
                        less relief based on the assessment of the authority. This complete failure to actually
                        assess the condition of the two families leads to unequal distribution which works in
                        favor of increasing the inequality even more instead of decreasing it.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is an ineffective form of charity donation however effective the
                        people involved try to make it. The leading thinkers thought of this problem seriously
                        and built a theory that correctly categorizes the various forms of distribution errors
                        to solve it. The theory or philosophy is known as EA or Effective Altruism. Altruism is
                        a common term that describes the process of one member of a species helping another
                        member of the same species due to kinship. This form of kinship is widely found in human
                        society. Various people from several communities engage in altruism related activities
                        to boost morale, kinship and mutual understanding among themselves. This builds greater
                        and greater relationships that are long lasting and help for the continual evolution of
                        the entire species.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, effective altruism takes this common concept of human society and
                        tries to turn it into a much more organized form of charity. So, right now the various
                        NGOs and INGOs, they all try to alleviate the suffering in society by building various
                        trusts and foundations that act on trying to provide for the poor. We will discuss
                        poverty and how its details have progressed over the centuries later in the book. But,
                        one thing is for sure, humanity doesn&rsquo;t want to see others suffering so it tries
                        hard to get rid of that suffering through various methods. The methods might not all
                        work out but they are an example of humans trying to do their best to bring change to
                        the world. These changes guide humanity towards a path where all the people are equally
                        happy no matter their past. The past of people can be really traumatic. These traumas
                        are the collective skeletons in the closet of humanity. If there is anything, literally
                        anything in the world that can remove these skeletons from the closet, then it is an
                        imperative for the gifted individuals of society to get this to work. By getting this to
                        work, humanity will progress towards a better future. This future is what we will
                        discuss in much more detail in this book. The future doesn&rsquo;t look bleak in any way
                        at all. To prove this, we have this entire chapter. Right now, we are discussing EA, and
                        how it has come as a result of people putting their minds together to solve the problem
                        of inequality and insufficiency of charity. Remember, to apply EA in an effective way,
                        the existing forms of charity will have to adopt much better technologies. These
                        technologies have all arrived but they haven&rsquo;t been implemented in society.
                        Let&rsquo;s prove the power of EA in an example. We will later consider a similar
                        example to prove how difficult it is to implement.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Consider a rich lady living in a high rise apartment in New York
                        city. The lady, keen on news, passes her days seeing how various poverty stricken
                        regions around the world are getting poorer and the people in it are suffering more than
                        ever. Over seeing the news, she is overcome with grief and wishes to make a donation to
                        a local charity with its headquarters in New York. The charity is genuine and wishes to
                        help. But it knows how difficult it is to effectively manage funds coming to it. Various
                        people around the world donate money through its website. The website sees a lot of
                        traffic. If the organization was not a not for profit company then it would be more
                        valuable than most of the publicly owned companies in the area. The company&rsquo;s
                        motto is&nbsp;&lsquo;Help the other person on the other side of the globe eat like you,
                        sleep like you, dream like you.&rsquo;&nbsp;This was enough to bring tears to many
                        people&rsquo;s eyes. So, the company was spinning all its gears. The gears were spinning
                        making the company&rsquo;s operations sky rocket. The initial phase of the
                        company&rsquo;s distribution began with the checklisting of all the funds and goods it
                        was going to donate. After that was done, it picked up half public volunteers and half
                        of its previous paid volunteers. Those volunteers that repeated their services were paid
                        compensation for their time. This model worked so it remained that way.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, after all the resources including human resources are ready, the
                        organization charters a plane. The plane houses all the people, equipment and goods to
                        be transported. When everything goes perfectly, the plane lands at the destination
                        airport where it is greeted by a local associate of the organization. One international
                        organization isn&rsquo;t able to handle operations in all the locations. This is why
                        local organizations from those places provide help with the aid. Now comes the difficult
                        part. The way those funds are distributed. It works through some indirection along with
                        guidance from the organizations. The local district office may or may not get involved
                        depending upon the district level policies of the nation. The ultimate stretch however
                        is the same. People come, register themselves in a register book. After some days, when
                        the funds and the short list is ready, most if not all of the people that registered
                        make long queues outside of the distribution center. The distribution centers can be
                        single or multiples. One by one, each of the people standing in the line get their
                        portion of the aid and head home. This is the hallmark of charity donation today.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now comes EA. EA is just a form of the above charity example but in
                        which the people involved try to maximize the outcome. The outcome in the above example
                        is indecent. The most needy people get the same amount as the least needy people. This
                        imbalance is inherent in such distribution schemes. To overcome this, one must endorse
                        the principles of EA completely.</p>

                    <p>*EA will be continued later on*</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c44"></a>A good samaritan</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any human being living in a society must follow the rules of the
                        society. He/she must make choices and decisions based on reason and according to what
                        looks suitable. This choice combined with one&rsquo;s attitude and behavior towards
                        others in the society is what pushes him/her into manhood. Life looks short to everybody
                        when they are doing something that is fun and engaging but it looks extremely long when
                        one is having to pass each day in agony. In the middle lie people who don&rsquo;t view
                        life as anything deserving much thought. They just go on with their daily rituals,
                        grooming themselves and taking care of their families until something unexpected happens
                        to their loved ones, making them question everything for the first time. In such times,
                        if one is unable to build a good outlook upon society and the rhythm of human life and
                        death, he/she will not be able to handle the shock coming their way.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the duty of a person living in a society then? Well, first of
                        all, everybody must maintain their composure in various situations. Since life has been
                        hard ever since the origin of life, one must learn to do hardship. Without hardship,
                        nothing good may come in one&rsquo;s life. Secondly, if one is to abide by the
                        society&rsquo;s norms, he/she must bear good discipline and good attitude. Without these
                        two, one will not be a functioning cog in the society. Love is necessary. One must have
                        some love for the place where he/she is living. She must love the local music, local
                        language and local traditions and culture. Without rousing this love for the place she
                        is living, she is not going to matter much. Not mattering much to others will make her
                        feel even more sad. This is not a good cycle to continue. So, in conclusion, a good
                        samaritan must love her locality, understand its people and deal with the ever difficult
                        problem of living itself.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The purpose of this section is to give you the reader an idea of what
                        your duty in a sense to this world is. You don&rsquo;t necessarily have any obligations
                        forced upon you by others but being a functioning human resource, you will have to show
                        some deference to the community you are living. There may be a shop in your community
                        where you live so it is a basic common sense for you to not rob it. If you do, you are
                        basically robbing your own house. You have a relationship with the community like the
                        blood relationship you have with your family. Like the proverb,&nbsp;&lsquo;Blood is
                        thicker than water&rsquo;,&nbsp;your connection to your community is much stronger than
                        your forged relationship with some other nation&rsquo;s community. The second one is
                        hypothetical while the first is real and you are continuously made aware of the fact as
                        you go to take a walk each day.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title of this section is just&nbsp;&lsquo;A good
                        samaritan&rsquo;&nbsp;so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to go in much detail about your
                        contribution to the world. But to give you a hint, it is just that you must not cause
                        problems if you can&rsquo;t fix them. This basic tenant will make you a much better
                        person and will automatically help others living around you. Another thing a good
                        samaritan must do is to share ideas. Now, this is starting to sound like religious talk
                        but it is not. One is not always obliged to just share religious notions. One is also
                        able to share big and profound ideas that are world changing. If tomorrow you
                        miraculously find a cure to cancer, then it is your moral imperative to share it to the
                        world the day after that.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c45"></a>The power of ideas</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we enter into the heart of the book. We start by describing the
                        power of ideas. The aim of an innovator is to take a proposition and produce a working
                        utility object. This object often comes in the form of an idea. Didn&rsquo;t understand?
                        Let me give an example. The problem of diseases which we talked about in so much detail
                        in the beginning of this chapter, is a very big and lingering problem of humanity.
                        Whatever methods and schemes humans have tried, they haven&rsquo;t been able to get rid
                        of the problem of disease and sickness. This is without a doubt due to insufficiency of
                        technology. Today, we don&rsquo;t have enough technological prowess to &nbsp;eradicate
                        even the age-old problems of poverty, starvation and illiteracy. These problems are not
                        new problems that arrived due to some new change brought upon human society. These
                        problems have existed since time immemorial and show no hope of going away by
                        themselves. We are having to actively try to get rid of these problems by ourselves for
                        now. The problem with petty humans trying to figure out solutions to long lasting
                        problems is trying to cope with their resiliency. These problems have stayed with us
                        forever. Now, just by us trying our best, they are going to go away. They will try to
                        persist and we will have to persevere. If we give up suddenly, even the most developed
                        countries will have to face the same issues that the third world countries of Africa are
                        facing. What will solve this problem then? The answer is simple, ideas.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ideas have the power to get rid of age old problems and to rip them
                        off the face of the earth. They are the monsters who love devouring other monsters
                        whole. They are very much the quintessential example of infinity stones. Their power is
                        unmatched. To see this, let&rsquo;s consider an example. Suppose in 1880, a problem has
                        been bothering a patch of the world since a long time. Let&rsquo;s say the problem is
                        dysentery. Many people living in connected communities blame various phenomena as the
                        cause of the plight but after dealing with each of those individually, no resolution
                        comes and the problem still remains. Suddenly after a year, in one part of the world, a
                        new theory is developed. The theory describes how diseases transfer in various mediums
                        through infection. The theory becomes so powerful in explaining local vexations that its
                        information spreads throughout the world like wildfire. Suddenly, after around a year,
                        an idea arises. The idea arises in another part of the world. The idea was to use some
                        lemon and phenyl to turn dirty water into clean looking water. The reason many people
                        liked this idea was because it was preventing them from getting sick. This information
                        gets noticed by the community facing the problem of dysentery. Without a second thought,
                        everybody starts to mix phenyl solution into their drinking water. After that, nobody
                        gets sick ever. The everlasting problem of dysentery due to sewage mixed river water is
                        fixed.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The above example provides a good example of how proliferating ideas
                        can be. Ideas literally bloom like mushrooms. They simply can&rsquo;t stop popping up.
                        The best of the best ideas find themselves being useful to a lot of people in various
                        communities. This is a kind of evolutionary process in itself. The playing field is the
                        human society and the selectors are the humans. This type of evolution is different from
                        non-human centered evolutionary processes like biological evolution and random emergent
                        evolution. Nobody knows how many types of evolutionary forces exist in nature itself.
                        There may be many or there may be very few but there is no doubt that these forces alone
                        have the power to dramatically alter the natural physical progression of things.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So there is no doubt that ideas that pack a punch and evolutionary
                        processes that have been in continuation are powerful but are they also pervasive?
                        Imagine a powerful hyper car. Say Bugatti Chiron. The car is the most powerful without a
                        doubt but is the car also the most commonly produced car in the world? Well, no. The car
                        may rank the highest in pure power but it ranks the lowest in production. Only 500
                        Chrions have ever been produced and sold. This unaspiring number is the result of the
                        cost of production of each Bugatti Chiron in the factory. The Chiron uses alloys that
                        are so hard to make that only few vendors exist for the raw materials. The car is fast
                        and has a top speed of 460 kmph. Its race track version, the Bugatti Bolide is even
                        faster and packs a top speed of around 500 kmph. These insane speeds are a result of
                        very fine craftsmanship that takes thousands of hours for completing each car coming out
                        from the factory. So there is no doubt that this kind of artisanship is only seen few
                        and far between. The scarcity of this type of handiwork, technique and artistry is the
                        reason why there aren&rsquo;t many hyper cars in the world even though they are the peak
                        of automobile manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The idea to create a Bugatti Chiron exists but on the other hand, the
                        idea to make its production easy and fast doesn&rsquo;t. So, the idea to create a
                        Bugatti Chiron isn&rsquo;t a powerful idea at all. Don&rsquo;t get this point wrong. The
                        car is a thing of beauty but it also isn&rsquo;t a world changing thing. The iPhone on
                        the other hand is completely opposite in this sense. It is widely available being so
                        easily mass producible while also being cheap for a low income family to buy one for all
                        of the members. These traits put the iPhone in a completely different category than a
                        Chiron. While the Chiron is big and bold, the hallmark of the iPhone puts it up several
                        notches high when compared to the Chiron. That makes the idea of an iPhone that is a
                        computing device operated with the touch of a finger while being small enough to put in
                        a pocket much more powerful than the similar idea of a Chiron. You might say the objects
                        are completely different in terms of their size and function so it is unfair to put them
                        side to side for comparison but the thing is we are not talking about the objects
                        themselves. We are only talking about the revolutionary aspects of each of them. Both of
                        them contain various parts like the alloys of the Bugatti and similarly the camera of
                        the iPhone. The Bugatti might even contain a dashboard display with a similar UX to that
                        of the iPhone. But, when we talk of the Bugatti, we are talking about the entire car,
                        not the dashboard. The entire car is less revolutionary compared to the presiding
                        iPhone.</p>

                    <p>*if possible this section will be 10 pages long*</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our bodies are made of meat and flesh. These vital but otherwise
                        disgusting sounding things are what constitute us. We are made of the same meat that we
                        like to eat of other animals. The reason for this is because meat requires meat to grow.
                        In nature, animals like lions and other prime predators like to hunt and eat subordinate
                        creatures in the food chain. The subordinate creatures would have liked to eat the prime
                        creatures themselves but nature forced them to occupy their particular niche from which
                        they find difficult to escape. That means they are basically stuck in their niche
                        forever. One reason this hierarchy has been so stable over millions of years is due to
                        the extreme adaptation of the animals. Nature finds its ways in various courses of
                        actions. What intelligent entity in this universe would design a food web in which the
                        creature at the bottom becomes the food at the top. These peculiar types of evolutionary
                        heritage that animals have come to inherit from the previous era is why every creature
                        is immovably bound to the hierarchy of dominance. Even if a creature at the bottom wants
                        to move up the ladder, it can&rsquo;t. The myriad of natural forces that guide the
                        ecosystems just act against it. What is the function of us then? We don&rsquo;t fall in
                        the category of those powerless creatures. We are the dominant species on the entire
                        planet and that is not because we&rsquo;ve got sharper teeths or longer wingspan. It is
                        instead because we have the most developed brains in the entire animal kingdom and this
                        organ single handedly beats all the other evolutionary jackpots that other species have
                        won in the animal kingdom. Due to this reason, we think of ourselves as flawless. But
                        the sad truth is that we are not. We are a petty species that got the opportunity of
                        world domination and we grabbed that. Other than that, nature didn&rsquo;t make us a
                        perfect creature in any way. The only things that nature gave us are limbs, a body, a
                        head. These biological heritages are all we got. Currently if we contract some disease
                        that destroys any of these vital bits, we have no way of replacing them. Neither do we
                        have effective means of curing dangerous injuries inflicted upon the organs. If a spear
                        made 2 million years ago pierces straight through the heart of our modern evolved body,
                        even with our advanced technology, we die. This portrayal of our pitiful condition is
                        not meant to be a discouraging fact about humanity. The goal here is to illustrate how
                        we have not really progressed much in the last two million years when it comes to saving
                        our ass from dangerous objects. And with that progress, you might think we will never be
                        able to transcend our biological limitations. But that cannot be further from the truth.
                        We humans are surprisingly good at changing things. The things that were true in the
                        past cannot be said to be true for certain in the future. The future is open to many,
                        actually infinite, interpretations while the past is limited to the one that has already
                        happened. This is the single reason why the future created by the best of humanity is
                        going to be better than you think. But will it actually be created by the best of
                        humanity and not the worst? Many will say it is yet to be seen so we cannot say for
                        certain. But the truth is, the future in the past has been mostly, actually 99% of the
                        time, created by the best of humanity. Putting aside some of the atrocious doings by
                        evil leaders and dictators, the past has been shaped by scientists, inventors and
                        artisans who are the best of humanity. These forerunners are the reason why the majority
                        of us today in affluent societies can live in abundance. Yeah, so we can be pretty
                        certain that the future will be shaped by good people with good thinking and not by bad
                        people with evil intentions. Mindset is the important thing here. If many people have a
                        good mindset then the whole world will slowly gain a good mindset also. For this to
                        happen, technology is vital. We will talk about this in the next section.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c47"></a>One society good, the whole world becomes good</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a vastly interconnected world like ours, most people have the
                        perception that society is degrading. Bad actors are cornering the good actors and
                        turning them bad. But this cannot be more wrong. When online forums where people can
                        debate exist, often than not, the good people take precedence over the bad people. This
                        happens because the good people&rsquo;s ideas resonated with a lot of others. This
                        remarkable fact is the reason why the western culture gained popularity and became
                        global instead of Indian or Arabian culture. The western sense of art and beauty is
                        better than the Indian sense. Everybody has different traditions, that is true but it is
                        also true that some traditions are inherently better than others because of their
                        virtues. It is seldom true that bad virtues outstrip the good ones. The bottom rung of
                        the society can climb up but it cannot pull the top rung down. The top rung of society
                        becomes resilient to bad additions and changes that might affect it adversely, they want
                        to stay in their apt place because that is appropriate. Nobody in their right mind would
                        replace their good outlook of life and beauty with a bad one.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The world is big so it requires a certain amount of time for
                        information to travel across it and reach from one part to another. Today the fast
                        internet has reduced the time from days with the pony express to a few milliseconds.
                        Before, the pony express was the only method and it was ridiculously slow which is why
                        many people preferred to be uninformed rather than go through the hassle of sending a
                        post box mail.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c48"></a>Executions by horrible methods</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the past, the people holding power became afraid that their power
                        would be seized. This irrational fear drove them crazy to the point that to make the
                        public or the rebels afraid, the king or ruler employed various painful execution
                        methods. These executions unheard of today were so violent and extreme that the mere
                        description of these sends shivers down one&rsquo;s skin. Let&rsquo;s discuss some of
                        these execution methods.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Flaying: Flaying was a common form of execution method employed by various kings
                                living in various kingdoms across today&rsquo;s Syria. The art of proper flaying
                                was supposedly a skill many possessed. The main goal while flaying a person was
                                to keep him alive for as long as possible. This is actually more difficult than
                                one might think. The exposure of a skinless body to nature&apos;s elements for a
                                long amount of time leads to infection and death. Blood loss is another big
                                problem. If the skin is cut too randomly then blood pouring out of the exposed
                                tissues leads to oxygen levels decreasing throughout the body and death follows.
                                So, to prevent this, the executioner preferred to cut through the most fleshy
                                parts of the body in order to avoid cutting through important arteries and
                                veins. This is why they tended to cut the buttocks of the victim first. The
                                buttocks lack any kind of major arteries and they mostly contain flesh and fatty
                                tissues.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This method of torture or execution depending on how one would like
                        to view it, is described in ancient texts to be extremely painful and agonizing. When
                        talking about this, one can&rsquo;t help but imagine why on earth would one human do
                        this to another human knowing perfectly well how excruciating it all is.</p>
                    <ol start="2">
                        <li>
                            <p>The breaking wheel: The breaking wheel is a harrowing example of the limit of
                                human imagination when it comes to tormenting others. Like the title mentions,
                                this method consists of a big wheel. The body of the victim is strapped to the
                                wheel from the legs to the arm joints. The body of the condemned is completely
                                naked. After this, the only thing remaining is for the executioner to start the
                                ordeal. The executioner&rsquo;s helper begins to rotate the wheel. While the
                                wheel is rotating slowly, the executioner takes a hammer and starts violently
                                hitting the condemned body. The purpose being to break as many bones as
                                possible.While the wheel is turning and bones are breaking, the sufferer screams
                                in agonizing pain. After this, the hammer in the executioner&rsquo;s hand is
                                replaced with a knife. The knife is a peeling knife specially made for the
                                purpose of cutting the skin and ligaments of the victim. To begin this part of
                                the torment, the wheel is stopped. The executioner himself takes control of it
                                and rotates it to exactly place the part of the victim&rsquo;s body where
                                cutting is to be done. When the cutting is done for various parts, the
                                executioner takes the hammer again and breaks those parts. This process is
                                repeated until the victim is completely helpless and immobile. The execution
                                will finish when the victim dies. This can take between a few hours to a few
                                days. This method of execution is equally terrifying as flaying.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Impalement: Execution by impalement is just impaling the victim&rsquo;s body with
                                a sharp stake. The stake used is very sharp and can easily penetrate the soft
                                flesh of the human body. The death in this method is usually due to blood loss
                                or if the impalement is done right across where the heart is located. This stops
                                the heart and the victim dies of oxygen depletion in the brain. This method can
                                be the quickest if wanted or longest. But in any of the methods mentioned till
                                now, the victim usually cannot stay alive for more than a week due to heavy
                                infection at the injury sites.</p>
                        </li>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Impaling can be excruciatingly painful or not painful at all. Every
                        animal has a shock inducing mechanism in their body which prevents them from suffering
                        extreme pain. But this happens in the first moment only. Later on, the agonizing pain
                        sets in and the body doesn&rsquo;t refuse to take the pain in. This is why impalement
                        can be a slow death that can result in untold amounts of suffering to the individual.

                            <p>Burning on the stake: What happens when you combine impalement with fire? Both
                                can be separately used as torture methods but when they are combined, they
                                result in an amalgam of shearing pain and blunt pain. Fire is very painful and
                                when you burn an exposed wound, the nerves that take the heat rapidly fire
                                pulses into the brain giving a very large amount of pain to the person. This is
                                why burning on the stake was so cruel and evil when it was used as the prime
                                execution method in medieval Europe for killing alleged witches. Human history
                                is filled with various wicked times which form a picture that is hard to
                                reconcile today. How could the past be so atrocious and heinous is something
                                most of today&rsquo;s historians find difficult to answer.</p>

                            <p>The brazen bull: What could be the most horrifying form of execution? I mean, if
                                you combine fire and stake, you get a horrible but comparatively a very quick
                                death. Now if you take the shearing pain of fire but make it long lasting by not
                                transferring it directly that is slowly roasting the flesh of the human body
                                instead of quickly turning everything into ash, then that would surely produce a
                                far greater amount of pain. One way to do that is to use some sort of metal, put
                                one side of it in contact with the human and another side of it with fire. The
                                fire would transfer the intense heat it is emitting to the body indirectly. The
                                amount of heat would be same but the time taken would be different. Put it into
                                the equation, delta Q = delta t * C where C is the specific heat, then when you
                                increase time, C would decrease. That means the heat transfer would happen
                                quickly in a longer amount of time. That is the definition of pain.</p>

                    <p>The reason we were looking into various methods of execution is to get a picture of the
                        evilness of humanity as a whole. What animal except humans would cause pain to its own
                        species. The very idea sounds diabolical. Kinship and love would easily prevent
                        emotional creatures from causing pain to their relatives, but let that relationship gap
                        be a little bit bigger than the threshold, one can be ready to do anything. How this is
                        even plausible is very confusing. This we talk about in the next section.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The popular belief among humans is that humans are a wise species.
                        That cannot be further from the truth. Most of humanity is some of the dumbest, most
                        ignorant and reckless beings among nature&rsquo;s children. There are various aspects of
                        humanity that in no way have a direct counterpart to other animals. Let&rsquo;s talk
                        about sadism. Serial killers are the best example o</p>
