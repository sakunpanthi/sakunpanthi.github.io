                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was born in the Khotang region of Nepal. He was an avid dreamer. He got
                        himself into a good school where his father used to teach and started his primary education
                        there. He was interested in space. He got interested in space specifically because he had read a
                        book titled &lsquo;A Brief History of Time&rsquo; when he was 9 years old. A nine year old child
                        fascinated by the writings of a scientific genius like Stephen Hawking was surely to have made a
                        life long lasting impression on him. Later after finishing his SEE from a relatively good
                        private school, he went on to become admitted in +2. He had chosen a good enough college with
                        low fees causing him to pass his +2 without exceptional grades. He never felt he needed to do
                        well in academics for doing what he loved, exploring. He went exploring hills and valleys of
                        Nepal in his uncle&apos;s motorcycle that came with a single cylinder petrol engine of 155 cc.
                        He first visited relatively well known regions of Nepal but later also drove with his pulsar in
                        some rather obscure parts of Nepal. He wanted to get a feel for experiencing nature in its true
                        form. Without one venturing into risky adventures he thought, one wouldn&rsquo;t come across
                        what&rsquo;s beautiful about the environment. Later after having enough of his bike rides, he
                        thought of getting an undergrad degree in physics. He didn&rsquo;t have good grades and was
                        academically not good. So he decided he would get into a space agency educational institution
                        that had recently been established by ex ISRO Nepali engineers in the capital city of Nepal
                        Kathmandu. ISRO was the Indian government organization that sent rockets to space using locally
                        manufactured hardware by government subsidized companies. Milky Nepal was the name of the space
                        institution Lasin went to. In his initial 6 months in the institution, he learnt about the
                        rocket equation, aerodynamics for rockets, cryogenic liquid fuel propulsion, satellite
                        manufacturing, ion propulsion, solid boosters, stage separation, NASA&rsquo;s moon rocket the
                        Saturn V and so much more. Getting to learn all these high level topics he found interesting and
                        applicable in the rocket field without worrying about grades allowed him to elevate his skills
                        in real life spacecraft engineering. The program was a 3 year talent building scheme designed
                        towards producing Nepal&rsquo;s own space manpower. Lasin was thrilled to apply his recently
                        acquired knowledge to build an actual space center in Nepal. During his adventures all across
                        Nepal he saw many land regions suitable for building a center with efficient supply of building
                        materials and workers. As he dreamed about the center, he outlined what was going to be needed
                        for it to be a reality. After long hours of consideration, he found that workers would be a
                        problem. Since Nepal didn&rsquo;t have a good economy, many technical skilled workers left the
                        country in what was a massive brain drain to the nation. This led to huge gaps in unfilled
                        worker segments that had to be replaced by workers who already occupied another segment of the
                        economy ladder. Lasin knew this would be a huge problem later because he remembered his
                        uncle&rsquo;s business going completely bankrupt due to unavailability of skilled workers. The
                        impregnable cycle of training a worker in the technical field then the worker leaving the nation
                        in search of better pay thereby rendering the investment of the company to train the worker
                        completely useless to its growth led to bankruptcy of the company. Citizens may blame this for
                        the country&rsquo;s political and economical situation but the reality is countries like Nepal
                        were already so poor when the other first world countries developed that it became near damn
                        impossible for them to bounce back. Lasin had this knowledge of economic growth and output of a
                        country. He gained this knowledge from his father. His father was an economics teacher at a
                        local college in Khotang. Since Lasin left Khotang for his +2, he didn&rsquo;t get the
                        opportunity to spend lots of time with his father in his later teen years. Not getting the
                        necessary advice from his father that he needed to earn good money but not doing big things, he
                        never cared a lot about earning money through the easy way. He was interested in doing big
                        things that were big enough to change the outlook of society upon itself. He wanted his country
                        to surpass everyone through its culture. He wanted Nepal to present itself as a global seed of
                        modernisation endeavors whether it be about safe and unpolluted water able to produce with an
                        energy input of a matchstick and output of more than 10 liters with that limited energy. Limited
                        energy was the key to his thinking. According to him, energy, however cheap, must always be
                        taken care of and must be made as efficient as possible. This was necessary because in order to
                        do great things that required 10 to 100 times more energy than current output, the ability to
                        reduce that by even 1% would make a huge difference to the total energy stock. Remember, energy
                        is never free so the ability to optimize on available energy meant greater economic output.
                        Lasin had thought through all this, he still saw the workers problem to be a massive hurdle in
                        his space center undertaking. If he was able to generate enough capital so as to attract migrant
                        workers from neighboring countries like India which had a massive population that could be
                        considered an infinite pool for Nepal&rsquo;s requirements by providing 10 to 15% better pay
                        than them then this problem would definitely be solved. So what was Lasin planning?
                        Lasin&rsquo;s ultimate goal was a vague idea of converting Nepal&apos;s agro based economy into
                        a completely space dependent economy by providing massive cost cuts on space launches provided
                        the launch itself would generate enough revenue to further grow the plan. These massive cost
                        cuts were difficult to come by. Nepal with its baby steps in space exploration had to compete
                        with the already proven and established giants like Spacex, NASA and ESA. Spacex was notoriously
                        difficult to compete with for Lasin because they had mastered the amazing feat of propulsively
                        landing a liquid fueled rocket booster on top of a barge in the middle of the ocean. This led
                        them to be very aggressive with their launch pricing causing everyone to look upon them for
                        launching their satellite cheaply into space. Lasin was pitted against the behemoths. Without a
                        solid plan he would not even have started and be thrown away from the arena.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But was such a thing possible in Nepal? Nepal was a poor country with almost
                        half of its people living in poverty and those also illiterate. If anything was left to do in
                        this country was giving quality education to these people and providing food to those who
                        weren&rsquo;t sure about their next plate. Throwing away vital money urgently required by those
                        starving people on something as inconsequential as the space race when it came to it&rsquo;s
                        trickling effects on the general economy was certainly a bad argument. So then why would Lasin,
                        a boy himself growing in a poverty stricken region, want to open a space company? There were
                        several reasons but the main reason was Lasin&rsquo;s thinking that Nepal, a country that had
                        nothing to prove its capability to serve the global economic engine, could at least show the
                        behemoths that it got the guts to tryon radical new stuff to change its trajectory suddenly.
                        Imagine if Bhutan launched a rocket. A country that didn&rsquo;t even have a steel processing
                        factory and the only carbon negative country. Well at least Nepal had some metal works ability.
                        The IT sector existed in Nepal for some time but the reach of the internet to the general
                        populace had taken a longer time than necessary which made it difficult for startups booming to
                        continue to fund their business that were going in deficit. Nevertheless, the IT sector made
                        some recovery and made a comeback along with the smartphone age which made the internet
                        available to all by putting cheap computing devices in everyone&rsquo;s pockets. That however
                        wasn&rsquo;t enough to stop the brain drain that was happening and destroying the pace of growth
                        of the entire country. If the young generation left their country all the time, the country for
                        sure wasn&rsquo;t going to develop by itself. To prevent stagnation, the only doable thing was
                        to stop the talent exodus which would of course require massive efforts but would be feasible.
                        How would a country stop its citizens from leaving it? The only solution that wouldn&rsquo;t
                        involve a dictatorship banning all transports out of its territory was for the nation itself to
                        prosper and provide economic prospects to those young generations. Brain drain did a lot of harm
                        to the stability of a country. The country&rsquo;s vital manpower that is its citizens should
                        not be allowed to decrease. Lasin knew this and he himself saw talent exodus happening all the
                        time. What could he do to prevent all this from happening? Well he would obviously have to start
                        somewhere. The best action for Lasin would certainly be to establish some kind of industry which
                        required huge amounts of human labor and that would fuel the country&rsquo;s economy, provide
                        job to thousands and on the sidelines stop massive numbers of people leaving the country in
                        search of better opportunities outside the boundary. The space centered economy that Lasin had
                        envisioned would definitely work towards achieving that goal but it was not the easiest way to
                        do what was necessary. The space sector was expensive as hell and very prohibitive towards using
                        old technology. In a country where car and motorcycle engines were not produced and repairment
                        facilities existed few and far between, manufacturing a robust rocket engine capable of pushing
                        tons of flammable fuel through its exhaust was something unheard of. The previous countries that
                        had ventured into the space sector in the early 1950&rsquo;s like Russia and USA had a strong
                        foundation. They had the manufacturing and supply capability as well as massive amounts of
                        labor. The developed countries Switzerland, Morocco as well as most of the European countries
                        had the capability but didn&rsquo;t think it necessary to put their foot into the rocket
                        business. That was not something that attracted their societal group mind. China was behind when
                        it came to the ultra new technologies so it didn&rsquo;t move on towards developing space launch
                        capacity till late 1990&rsquo;s. India was the same. It inherited Russian developed space
                        technologies to grow its own space sector. Japan had none too. It didn&rsquo;t have a military
                        still, even when all other major countries had one. The rigorous definition of a country having
                        to have its own military didn&rsquo;t apply to Japan. Space was a derivation of rich military in
                        all the cases during its early instigation. That being the case, the country with insufficient
                        nationalism and lacking military infrastructure was not hoping to have a space capacity. Germany
                        made its rockets defunct after the failure of Hitler&rsquo;s V2 rockets to make any significant
                        impact upon world war 2. But it didn&rsquo;t defunct its consumer cars and heavy motors
                        manufacturing ability because they provided a good economic incentive not to. Notwithstanding
                        the fact that today Germany inherits a great lot of its industrial capacity from the dark Nazi
                        world war 2 era, it had increased its power in the consumer space massively and modernized all
                        its operations. Despite this however, Germany didn&rsquo;t yet have that power in the space
                        sector. It had to ask help from the foreign super powers like America and China for sending its
                        own satellites into orbit. Lasin found this fact absolutely pathetic. He didn&rsquo;t like how a
                        nation kept itself away from space even when it had the ability and the resources to have a
                        significant impact in the field.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nepal however was a totally different animal when it came to taming the space
                        beast. It had no experience and nothing. Lasin figured out that the best thing he could do was
                        start with some sort of rudimentary factory that made steel silos. These silos would then be
                        fitted with old used soviet engines. The specific impulse of those old soviet engines were
                        enough to lift a good size testing vehicle. The modern manufacturing methods used for building
                        new age space vehicles helped reduce the weight and size. The electronics had been greatly
                        simplified. In fact the old rockets didn&rsquo;t have any electronics at all. Modern rockets
                        were fitted with micro electronics that gathered data from all the sensor arrays fitted onto the
                        rocket engine and fuselage. This was amazing progress in such an eccentric and niche market. The
                        early rocket engineers really thought and considered the future entrepreneurs and designed their
                        rockets to be compatible with new emerging technologies like motor pumping, computer guidance,
                        full flow staged combustion, cryogenic fuel etc. Budding tech entrepreneurs were thus eager to
                        utilize the earlier developed science to grab their portion of stock.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c2">Chapter 2</a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day Lasin packed some clothes, some food, strapped them to his own
                        honda motorbike and left for Khotang. He arrived at his parents house early in the morning since
                        he left at 9 pm the previous day. On his way he saw a scene he was to remember for a long time.
                        He saw a bus returning back from Lafyang, Khotang suddenly losing its grip and falling into the
                        Trisuli river. This news was broadcasted to the entire Nepal the next day with reports of more
                        than 48 people dying in the accident. Lasin felt like something had to be done in the
                        transportation sector of Nepal otherwise people would keep dying like this. He came to the
                        realization that advancements in the space sector would provide rippling benefits to the people
                        in other sectors thereby uplifting the entire country from just one undertaking. This was the
                        moral obligation of his, Lasin thought. He must do something otherwise Nepal would crumble and
                        people would suffer even more. Lasin ate the delicious food his mother had cooked that morning
                        while watching the news of the accident on the radio. The cable network for television had not
                        yet reached the Lafyang region. The Internet was a far cry in regions where television was
                        absent. During the afternoon, Lasin was writing something in his journal. It was the preliminary
                        plans about establishing a space center office where Lasin would dream up ideas and execute them
                        with the help of the government. He later found out it was too early for that because when he
                        called the space agency he enrolled &nbsp;in 6 years ago asking about Nepal government&rsquo;s
                        plan about establishing a space center by private individuals, he got the reply that the Nepal
                        government didn&rsquo;t have any such plans. This wasn&rsquo;t what he was expecting. He thought
                        he would contact the government or do what it would take and ask for cheap land for private
                        lease and establish a space center office there. Since the government didn&rsquo;t have any
                        plans about sending rockets into space, he moved towards doing it himself. Lasin called his
                        friend Niban who studied with him at Milky Way. Niban was an amateur systems engineer and
                        designer for rockets. He was capable of taking raw materials and passing them through molding
                        machines in order to manufacture the fuselage, nose cone and base of the rocket. Niban agreed to
                        Lasin&rsquo;s plan to open a rocket company in Nepal with homegrown technology. That evening
                        Lasin packed his things once more and headed to Namche Bazar of Solukhumbu. He visited that
                        place during his motorbike rides. He found it was a good spot for a rocket launch complex
                        because it was at a high altitude so it was efficient to launch rockets from there compared to
                        near sea level even by a fraction of a percent. But it was all about a fraction of a percent to
                        Lasin. While arriving at Namche Bazar the next morning, Lasin stopped by a hotel to book a room
                        for a week. Why was he staying for a week in the middle of a tourist zone? Because he wanted to
                        study the area thoroughly in order to construct a launch complex there. It was all about the
                        launch complex now. Previously many space agencies of Nepal thought of constructing a launch
                        complex but none had succeeded. Now a visionary like Lasin could be able to do what many before
                        him couldn&rsquo;t simply because of their lack of execution. Nepal was a poor nation so funding
                        for a space launch complex construction by the government would be really hard to imagine.
                        Instead Lasin was thinking of a new system of worker compensation through the use of crypto to
                        funnel in money from foreign venture capitalist investors that were interested to earn some
                        money from the relatively far risky prospect of a rocket company after what they saw with
                        startups like Spacex and Electron. It was nearly impossible for Lasin&rsquo;s plan to be
                        successful since the government had enacted a ban on crypto trading because of its potential
                        harm to Nepal&rsquo;s economy by taking money from the country and trading it for foreign stocks
                        without paying a dime of tax money. A new software developed by a fellow Chinese gave Lasin
                        something to work with. It was called LaborPay. LaborPay specialized in paying labor money for
                        foreign workers for their work contribution to the affiliated company. Lasin didn&rsquo;t have
                        any idea how he would go about paying local workers with foreign dollars without the notice of
                        the government so he decided to make fake documents of a new IT startup company specializing in
                        astronomical readouts through an app on a smartphone. Since smartphones were ubiquitous and vast
                        majority of people were still religious superstitious, he thought by faking the numbers the app
                        was downloaded as an apk on the android platform directly through the website, he could convince
                        the government that the massive revenue generated through in-app purchases would be the money
                        the workers at the launch complex project were paid with. The plan was all set. All he needed to
                        do now was execute it. He stopped his bike at a plot of land high above a molehill in the Namche
                        Bazar central village. He saw people carrying bricks and logs on their back in a locally
                        manufactured basket contraption called &lsquo;doko&rsquo;. He thought all he needed was some
                        capital and he could utilize the labor of those people for less money than what other rocket
                        companies abroad were paying for their workers. He pulled out his notebook from his backpack and
                        quickly glanced at the size of the plot of land and compared it with the requirement outlined on
                        his smartphone pdf. He found out he needed to extend the plot by some 6 meters in order to make
                        sure. The mole hill was a peculiar spot for a launch complex construction because no vehicle no
                        matter the size would be able to haul the rocket on top of it. Why did Lasin want to build the
                        complex on such a difficult spot? Well it was all about view angle. What view angle? View Angle
                        referred to the angle at which something was viewed from a vantage point. Nepal consisted of
                        lots of molehills and high hills so if the rocket complex was built on flat land then a hill
                        would surely block it rendering the sight unseeable from a distance of a few kilometers. Funding
                        for a space venture almost always came from people&rsquo;s excitement. People when they became
                        excited about a new prospect tended to urge the government to increase it and when they were not
                        excited tended to urge the government to decrease it. Since government funding is always
                        taxpayer&rsquo;s money, this fact couldn&rsquo;t be overlooked. So if Nepal&rsquo;s first space
                        complex was built on top of a hill like the famous Swayambhunath temple of Sundhara, Kathmandu,
                        the project would attract lots of tourists who would come for sightseeing thereby generating
                        lots of revenue for businesses around the perimeter of the mole hill. This would increase
                        people&rsquo;s excitement, increasing government funding thereby equipping the company for
                        upgrading the &nbsp;launch complex for heavier rockets and on the sidelines generating massive
                        revenue from tourism. This would inevitably have ripple effects on lesser developed parts of the
                        country. It would change the face of the country for sure and Lasin couldn&rsquo;t be more happy
                        with that prospect. Lasin called Niban again to talk about everything he had thought of. Niban
                        felt excited but got scared thinking about the daunting task laying in front of them. So now it
                        was all about doing the things and seeing whether it worked or not. Niban arrived at Namche the
                        following day all tired and nauseated. The bus travel in hilly parts of Nepal was not a pleasant
                        experience. Many people vomited at the windy road turns because of the bus exhaust odor. The
                        buses in Nepal were old and comprised 1950&apos;s models. This caused fumes leakage that induced
                        headache and nausea among the passengers.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a day of rest, Niban felt good again to talk to Lasin about their launch
                        complex plans. Niban was from Butwal. He was born in Sukhanagar. Namche was a good spot Niban
                        thought but a better spot would be Butwal he said. Butwal&rsquo;s Nuwakot hill was &nbsp;a
                        booming area with a cable car infrastructure in place but which was not yet operational due to
                        budget shortcomings. Suddenly an idea dawned on Niban&rsquo;s head. The sturdy steel cables were
                        more than strong enough for suspending up to 5 tons of weight at one time. The hill didn&rsquo;t
                        have any wide roads with the ability to make room for a plane or rocket cross section. If they
                        could lease the land and construct their complex there then surely the cable infrastructure
                        would come in handy for transporting large rocket fuselages without any road infrastructure to
                        allow a 18 wheeler truck to pass through.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was an ordinary night in the middle of an ordinary hut cottage disguised
                        as a night stay hotel by local people to generate a revenue in the Everest climbing craze that
                        occupied foreigners&rsquo; mind to come to the small hilly country of Nepal but right then in an
                        ordinary &nbsp;situation they were contemplating the most extraordinary thing their generation
                        or the generation before them had ever contemplated, transporting rockets to the top of a hill
                        in cable cars.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c3">Chapter 3</a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Niban and Lasin outlined the method for the transportation of rockets in
                        their shared notebook while also detailing the total cost that would amount for the construction
                        and labor pay. It seemed reasonable like any other startup cost so they thought it would all
                        work out for a second while glossing over the fact that they were undertaking the most difficult
                        construction project any nation had ever taken without the vital support of the government. Let
                        it be then they thought, it&rsquo;s all privatized now like the construction of houses and
                        hotels, no need for the government to be involved in this. &ldquo;Ok then,&rdquo; Lasin said,
                        &ldquo;Lets go to the municipality office of Butwal asking for the land lease and show them the
                        outline of the project and whether they are interested in funding it or not&rdquo;.
                        &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Niban added, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this then!&rdquo; The petals were
                        falling. It was the middle of autumn and the scorching summer heat of the previous month had
                        passed by. They arrived at the Butwal municipality office the next day on their bikes. They
                        waited outside and said they wanted to see the mayor. &ldquo;The mayor is busy, come next
                        week.&rdquo; replied the mayor&rsquo;s PA. &ldquo;We have urgent things to discuss with him,
                        allow us for a minute and he&rsquo;ll decide if he&rsquo;s interested or not.&rdquo; answered
                        Lasin. &ldquo;Ok, let me see.&rdquo; After fumbling around for a minute, the mayor&rsquo;s PA
                        finally pulled his phone out and started typing the mayor&rsquo;s number. &ldquo;Hello sir, I
                        just called you to check if you are busy. If you&rsquo;re busy then I&rsquo;ll keep
                        quiet.&rdquo; The mayor&rsquo;s reply may have been no, so the PA added, &ldquo;Sir, I have two
                        guys that want to see you. They say they have some urgent things to discuss. Should I send
                        them?&rdquo; The mayor may have said ok so he let them in. &ldquo;Hello, sir.&rdquo; Lasin
                        started.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yes, you wanted to see me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It was about taking land on a lease.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Ok, tell me more. Which land and at what premium?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sir, actually we want the government to offer us a discount.&rdquo; added Niban.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Discount? But why would a government give private individuals a discount? Where would the
                        tax money come from?&rdquo; the mayor added.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Um, actually the land will be used to construct a major space center complex that will be
                        used to provide space launch facilities to our global government partners like India, China and
                        possibly if we can do this cheap enough, European countries and US as well.&rdquo; Lasin
                        replied.</p>
                    <p>The Mayor was dumbfounded. After staring at Lasin&rsquo;s eyes for more than 20 seconds, he
                        finally blinked and added,</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You want to do what?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yes sir, here&apos;s the brief outline of the project. We would like for the government to
                        invest in it as well.&rdquo; Lasin answered smiling. &ldquo;Does this sound reasonable
                        sir?&rdquo; he added.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, of course. But why Butwal? Why not Kathmandu? Or Pokhara? Or any other
                        municipality?&rdquo; the mayor said back.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about efficiency sir.&rdquo; Niban told the mayor. &ldquo;We want to build
                        a launch complex in Butwal because in all of Nepal Butwal has turned out to be the best location
                        for this endeavor.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;But, it would be far easier for the more powerful Kathmandu&rsquo;s mayor to approve such
                        projects.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;No sir, it would be difficult there. There&apos;s no cheap land as the available land has
                        high demand, so the price is very high.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Ok, come to me next week.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure sir&rdquo; Niban finished.</p>

                    <p>The next day, Niban and Lasin hopped on their bike and traveled to Nuwakot. There was the cable
                        car infrastructure that was unable to be finished. They saw exactly how that would come in
                        helpful to transport the rocket fuselages. The real problem though was manufacturing. Without
                        manufacturing rockets at low cost, no amount of innovation in the launching and landing front
                        would be beneficial. So they started to think about the manufacturing prospect and outlined some
                        ideas about how they would accomplish that. Before anything concrete came to their mind, they
                        started feeling hungry. They went to the nearby cottage and ordered two &frac12; plate chowmein
                        and two beer cans.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It might be more difficult than we think Lasin.&rdquo; Niban started.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Where there&apos;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way. And also we won&rsquo;t have to worry
                        about anything once we get the wheel spinning.&rdquo; Lasin replied.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah? How exactly?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, once we put things in place like manufacturing, transportation, contracts and
                        finally the glorious launches, the balls will get rolling and contracts will keep on flowing so
                        we won&rsquo;t have to worry about money anymore then.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;But, that&rsquo;s a far later prospect. When will we ever reach that point?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Niban, you are too invested in the problems of today and aren&rsquo;t seeing the vision
                        clearly. I would advise you to see the problems once they arise but right now I want you to set
                        your eyes towards the bigger goal of founding a space center in Nepal.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah sure..&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>One week later they both go back to the mayor&rsquo;s office and ask his PA for permission to
                        meet him. But this time the PA allows them without asking since he noted the appointment the
                        mayor gave them a week ago. Keeping this in mind, they both go to the mayor&apos;s office
                        expecting the mayor to welcome them. But instead the mayor was in a sad mood making an unlively
                        face. This came as a shock to both of them.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The mayor started to speak,</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Aeh ah&hellip; guys, look, I was trying to do my best regarding your vision towards a
                        space oriented country but circumstances didn&rsquo;t allow for it. Right now as you know there
                        is a local level election going on and I am facing major hurdles for my reelection because the
                        societal development plans that I laid out last year have been in a limbo and it seems as though
                        they aren&rsquo;t going to be finished by this month or next or even after that. I expect a
                        major delay in my campaign funding. You know how hard it is to do an election campaign in Nepal.
                        You have to roam all around the city and knock on each and everybody&rsquo;s house and convince
                        them as well as yourself that they will vote for you and not another. This is a very difficult
                        situation I am in right now. The budget isn&rsquo;t passing through as I expected and it is
                        causing high economic strain on the public. Right now giving that land in lease for a private
                        corporation at a discount seems oxymoron. Also the highway at Siddhababa seems congested and
                        supplying the building materials through the same route as you outlined would congest the
                        traffic flowing through it. &nbsp;So I&rsquo;m sorry, I cannot approve your project on that
                        land.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Really? We came here after one week to hear that?&rdquo; Lasin thought to himself.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sir, but I expect this project to be approved next month right?&rdquo; Lasin asked with a
                        straight face.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sorry, but no. I expect next month after my reelection, the corporation that took the land
                        for construction of a cable car line will be back in charge of it and continue the cable car
                        project . It is a more viable and sustainable source of income for us also. We have heavily
                        invested on the cable car project through our government bonds and expect it to pay us back
                        dearly. Ripping that cable car line which was promised to the citizens would have a negative
                        impact on the party also.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sir, but the cable car line will be necessary for us when the launch complex is finished.
                        We will use that to transport rockets on top of the hill.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Really? It wasn&rsquo;t mentioned on the blueprint. I thought you were going to use the
                        Siddhababa corridor for transporting rockets. By the way, now that I get some idea of how large
                        this project is going to be, may I ask you, how are you going to fund this? I don&rsquo;t think
                        you have money. Are you going to make a proposal for money and send it to the federal
                        government?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;No sir, of course not. Although we didn&rsquo;t outline our funding source in the project
                        book, we have a major IT company specializing in astronomical observation that is funding the
                        substantial portion of this venture.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Really? What&rsquo;s the name of the company? &ldquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;MilkyWay sir. They also have a 3 year undergrad equivalent course set to produce skillful
                        engineer level workers. They make and maintain the app which is currently released on the
                        Android platform.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well although I would love to be the host city for this amazing sounding project, my
                        managers are telling me to keep my hands out of this right now. Would love to talk to you in the
                        future as your project gains traction.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>They both leave the office looking pretty disappointed. One night suddenly a heavy thunderstorm
                        appeared in the sky. Lasin was in his room in Kathmandu. Niban was with his sister in Pokhara.
                        They both communicated sometimes through the phone but when it came to the project talk, they
                        both sounded exhausted and ended their calls.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c4">Chapter 4</a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin woke up in his pajamas. Suddenly, the cold breeze coming from the
                        window chilled his naked arm skin. Winter had arrived. Lasin folded his blankets and went back
                        to his nap. After struggling for a moment he woke up again. He was alone. Without a girlfriend
                        or somebody to lay beside him, he didn&rsquo;t get the motivation to work sometimes. Although it
                        was his passion to do good for the society in some ways big or small, it alway proved difficult
                        in a small underdeveloped country like Nepal where opportunities were hard to come by and
                        globalization influence had made it difficult to do extraordinary stuff locally. Lasin was a
                        visionary though, in the gentle breeze of wind, he could feel something tingling his skin hair.
                        He wasn&rsquo;t sure what was driving him but as he went to the kitchen wearing nothing but
                        shorts to prepare coffee, he started thinking about the problems he had during the autumn. He
                        wanted to do good but no matter what some hurdles struck him one after another. The coffee came
                        out too strong for his taste. He took a sip but immediately put it down. After a while he was
                        sitting by himself-made fireplace. Fireplace in an urban house was uncommon in Nepal. The
                        exhaust plumes didn&rsquo;t have anywhere to go when the floor plans for houses didn&rsquo;t
                        include a chimney. The privatization of houses and real estate in Nepal&rsquo;s cities had made
                        it difficult for a planned grid system to exist in the cities. The general process for building
                        a house in any city was to get your own land then moving towards designing the floor plan
                        however you liked using whatever construction materials you fancy although bricks and concrete
                        were the primary choice. Wooden houses were very uncommon even in Kathmandu where the
                        city&rsquo;s name literally includes &ldquo;wood&rdquo; in its title. The system of developers
                        planning and building houses which are then sold to the public didn&rsquo;t exist in Nepal.
                        Unsafe drinking water was a huge problem in Nepal&rsquo;s capital city Kathmandu. There had been
                        government planned projects for bringing drinking water to the city but it proved too costly to
                        be handled by the city&rsquo;s income source. Even the capital city of Nepal is too poor
                        compared to other countries&apos; sub par cities. Lasin knew all this. He wanted to bring safe
                        drinking water to his resident city. He made some drafts last year to submit to the government
                        but when it came to the implementation the government was slow, incompetent and uninterested in
                        his ideas. This time he wanted to implement some ideas himself. Some money he thought he had
                        planned to invest in the space complex could be used to solve this problem. For that he first
                        needed to update his draft somewhat. He removed some difficult to implement portions and
                        streamlined others. His idea was to use an advanced form of filter to sequester zinc and other
                        harmful substances from polluted water and make it safe for drinking directly without heating.
                        This process required input energy in the form of heat. Lasin saw heating as a problem because
                        heating leads to increased energy flow. Energy in his view should always be handled in a micro
                        manner that has no large amount of randomness induced inside the system. Heating didn&rsquo;t
                        allow for that. Heating as a process itself increased randomness exponentially provided
                        sufficient energy flowed into the system. Lasin saw this as a big problem. He almost scrapped
                        the entire plan to think of a better one. Later he came up with a form of induction heating that
                        heated only the part of water that had the highest concentration of zinc and other harmful
                        substances so that they could be readily reduced for extraction. He wanted to patent it although
                        not having the idea how to do it. After collecting sufficient documents, he went to the
                        metropolitan office of Kathmandu where he didn&rsquo;t find a clue either. After some research,
                        he found out that Nepal historically never required patenting services because the intellectuals
                        almost always left the country or belonged to the ruling class who didn&rsquo;t see the point of
                        patents for general citizens. After the bloody revolution led by Maoist movement, the government
                        came into some form of peace with the citizens but the citizens still suffered the limitations
                        of the previous generations such as not getting access to safe drinking water, not having good
                        access to education, not enjoying basic amenities the rich countries took for granted. Patenting
                        was one of those administrative functions that never got a hold in Nepal. The constitution that
                        came very late didn&rsquo;t introduce any concrete form of patent protection rights. That was
                        one of the reasons intellectuals still left the country in search of better opportunities. Lasin
                        thought the bureaucratic government was too kafkaesque to try to persuade to do anything. He
                        decided to form a holding company and register it under his name. This would at least give him
                        private company rights to do anything he pleased.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day he and his friend Niban registered a company named Ytiralugnis.
                        Ytiralugnis was the all encompassing company that would do everything Lasin and Niban together
                        thought of. Ytiralugnis according to Niban should specialize in space technologies foremost and
                        then use those technologies to build products that would then trickle down the society. Lasin
                        was finally ecstatic to do something useful. He remained awake the whole night that day and made
                        several drafts of what would be their first product. A highly advanced water purification
                        machine running at the energy of a matchstick burning for 10 liters of purified drinkable water.
                        This would surely prove successful in the market. Since the company right then was just a name
                        and nothing more, they didn&rsquo;t have any plans on how to go about manufacturing the machine.
                        Lasin thought of a traditional idea. He would order the parts through chinese manufacturers
                        specializing in several independent technology manufacturing like PCBs, condensers, portable
                        ring induction heaters, plastic molds, pipes, tanks and everything else. Independently ordering
                        all the parts could prove too messy so they decided they would give the entire draft of the
                        machine to third party chinese companies through licensing scheme and rebuy the machine at 145%
                        of the manufacturing cost. This would allow them to price the machine at 200% of the
                        manufacturing cost thereby turning a profit of 55% minus the transportation cost per purifier
                        sold. This turned out to be a little more than difficult in practice but they somehow were able
                        to talk one company into taking the license for 10 years at minimal fees without any loopholes.
                        This convinced them and they were producing 10 units every week starting the next month.
                        Transporting the product was costing them more money than seemed reasonable. Since Nepal
                        didn&rsquo;t trade with China in any extensive manner, the transportation infrastructure was
                        absent for large car sized purification machines. So they had to improvise by disassembling the
                        purification units into two to three smaller parts and reassembling them once their destination
                        had been reached. This entire project which lasted for about 8 to 9 months gave them huge
                        motivation for continuing their endeavors at the company and doing good for the society.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alamak who was a famous media personality and journalist in the Kathmandu
                        valley wanted to interview the founders of a company that was going viral on social media and
                        everyone was talking about. He wanted to get the inside perspective on what the visionaries that
                        founded this company thought. He was somewhat blown away by the versatility and robustness of
                        their first product which was nothing more than a water purification machine in its description
                        but then performed magic once connected to the grid. Seemingly out of electricity it could take
                        black residue out of Bagmati&rsquo;s dirty polluted water and turn it into the most clean
                        looking mineral water on the planet. What seemed like magic was nothing but a complicated
                        procedure that Lasin, one of the company&rsquo;s founders, himself drafted in the middle of a
                        restless night. Netizens also known as internet addicts, posted videos of the machine working in
                        their community and providing every house with virtually cost free safe drinking water right out
                        of their nearby rivers which were extremely polluted. Alamak, working in the technology field
                        for more than 20 years, never thought such a day would come. A home grown company making a
                        product that everybody needed not just in Nepal but in other countries but then none of the big
                        first world countries had ever done before. It was a similar case with Ruit who made the
                        cheapest eye lenses that could be surgically inserted into blind people&rsquo;s eyes making them
                        able to see again. Alamak interviewed Ruit once and was blown away by his humbleness and
                        intelligence. He thought he peaked his interviewing career with that but he came to find out he
                        was wrong. Lasin heard a knock on the door. Expecting it to be the interviewer who called him 3
                        hours ago asking for an interview, he swiftly checked himself in the mirror and went to greet
                        the reporter. Alamak couldn&rsquo;t hold his gaze. He was shaking a little bit. He never thought
                        intellectuals capable of doing extraordinary stuff were still in Nepal. Lasin&rsquo;s brilliant
                        personality reflected through his eyes and teeth. Alamak entered the house on Lasin&rsquo;s
                        request. Alamak started,</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s an honor.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Call me Lasin please. Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Thankyou for having us. Please introduce yourself and your company.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So yeah, my name is Lasin and I was born in Lafyang, Khotang district. My early childhood
                        went like any other kid in a rural village. I completed my studies till SEE form Khotang and did
                        my plus two in Kathmandu. I got my technical bachelor&apos;s degree from MilkyWay space agency.
                        I met my partner Niban there. Niban was also interested in space and technology like me. So it
                        only seemed right for us to partner together and establish a company where we would do what we
                        aspired to do together since we met. We wanted to build the first space center of Nepal that
                        would provide launch facilities to orbital tracking with large radio antenna dishes at much
                        lower cost than what is usual. This is still to be done as of now. But right now, we are making
                        some societal contributions by building products like advanced purifiers and water pumps that
                        consume a fraction of the electricity the normal ones consume. And as far as I can tell we have
                        been well received judging by our sales and customers&rsquo; reaction.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You see, in Nepal, it is very difficult to come up with an original product that can sell
                        well. What you and Niban have done is truly revolutionary. If I were to guess where the product
                        was made without knowing it then I would surely guess China or the US. But Nepal? Come on man!
                        It&rsquo;s truly astonishing.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Well, ironically the product is made in China but the design and specifications are
                        completely ours.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I get it. So you mentioned the space center. How come you guys are planning to build a
                        space center in Nepal? It&rsquo;s something only rich countries have been able to do. Not even
                        Japan has one right now.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So in the past it was so. Only rich first world countries that had solid economic backend
                        were able to build space launch centers. Suddenly, after the space shuttle was discontinued
                        during the Obama administration, private companies started to take over in the space sector in
                        the US. After those companies started to innovate and push the boundaries of what was thought
                        possible, the sector saw a huge growth in this field. These technologies, although breathtaking
                        at the time, are now common in every company. What we are trying to do is just to take advantage
                        of this massive manufacturing behemoth that has been set loose by the previous giants to produce
                        our own home grown rockets that will launch from our own centers all across Nepal so that we can
                        rapidly expand our presence in space.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Who set loose the behemoth free?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Previous giant companies like Spacex and Rocketlab who let go of their patents and
                        manufacturing hubs like China are taking full advantage of that right now. China has its own
                        fully reusable rocket that is competitive with spacex&rsquo;s starship and is also competing
                        with India&rsquo;s Garuda rocket. China and India aren&rsquo;t necessarily first world countries
                        but they have proven that space is open for everybody and is going to remain open for everybody
                        who wants to go there. Indonesia, Vietnam and even Bangladesh have showcased their prototype
                        rocket designs ready for their demonstration flight within the next five years. We as a small
                        hilly county should ride on this wave and must not remain behind. For it is our future
                        generation that is going to benefit from it the most. Like we despise our previous generation
                        for letting our country go to ruins, we cannot let that be the case for the next generation.
                        They must be proud to have been born in this country.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sir, I am honored you took this to talk to me. I wish you and the company all the
                        best.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Thank you! It was awesome.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin ordered one of the helper staff who was in his house to make some
                        lunch. Alamak was very happy to spend some more precious moments with Lasin. He got to talk
                        about more stuff off camera while eating. He left after 3 hours after gaining all the inside
                        perspective he initially wanted to do the interview for. Lasin was also delighted to share his
                        past experiences more openly and without worrying about the company&apos;s obligations. That
                        night Lasin invited Niban to his house and planned further expansion of their product base to
                        include air purifiers, induction cooktops, efficient generators, air conditioners, vacuum
                        cleaners and others. The company was now firing all its engines, hiring almost 90% of
                        MilkyWay&rsquo;s undergrads and providing lots of internship opportunities for other university
                        students. A week later, Lasin got a call from the mayor of Butwal asking for 10 units of the
                        purifier. Lasin, although hesitant at first due to high demands from other municipalities,
                        agreed and sent +10 orders notice from his phone to the company manufacturing in China.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c5">Chapter 5</a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;You dream of what you desire the most,&rsquo; this thought occupied
                        Lasin like a worm. One &nbsp;day, after finishing his university assignment, he took out his VR
                        goggles and got immersed in a virtual reality game. During his sleep that night, he dreamed
                        about actually living in that virtual reality. So the next day, he strapped two tiny motors onto
                        his controllers and connected them to the game&rsquo;s API. This allowed him to control the
                        motors with the game&rsquo;s assets and experience things like bow string tightening, horse
                        riding and other fantasy elements like he was almost there. This brought a vision inside him,
                        the future of this world may be fully virtual. One day, actual true abundance might be achieved.
                        All this through the application of virtual simulation. In virtual simulation, there was no real
                        worth to anything. Everything was just electrons moving around inside a chip. Whether it be a
                        billion dollar cruise ship or a 500 rupees burger, they both amounted to the same value
                        physically or outside the virtual simulation. Remotest parts of the globe where poverty took the
                        fun out of people&rsquo;s lives, plunging them into utter misery, shoving aside all basic
                        amenities one wanted, constantly torturing the mind, not allowing mental, physical, emotional
                        freedom the human body desired, making them feel like living in hell, all this would finally be
                        eliminated and people would finally be set free. Set free forever from the original reality that
                        crippled their soul by transferring into the virtual reality where absolute abundance, abundance
                        without limits was possible. This could be the greatest invention in humanity&rsquo;s history,
                        he thought. Lifting people from hell.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin woke with a lazy feeling. He immediately went to the kitchen to fetch a
                        coffee. This time, the coffee was just perfect. He sipped it while looking through the weekly
                        company financial reports. 14 purifiers, 55 motor pumps produced this week. Total sales: 14*(Rs
                        1,20,000) + 55*(Rs 15,000) = Rs 25,05,000. Total profit: 47.5% of total sales = 11,77,350. Lasin
                        seemed happy with the reports. He called Niban and asked him to focus on more efficiency in the
                        purifier&rsquo;s condenser mechanism since it, according to Lasin, was taking more than
                        necessary for a condenser.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chisisi Mostafa was the ambassador of Egypt to Nepal. He was in Egypt at the
                        time of Lasin and Niban founding their drinking water purification company. In Egypt, children
                        had to drink unsafe water mixing directly with the sewer originating from villages. This caused
                        periodic waves of diarrhea epidemic which took many lives every few months. This was a big
                        problem which hadn&rsquo;t been solved by the Egyptian government. Chisisi was taken aback when
                        he saw the massive flooding of the Nepalese market by a very advanced water purification machine
                        that could seemingly transform dirty diseases ridden water to very clean drinking water. It even
                        added minerals essential to the human body right inside the machine itself. According to Chisisi
                        this could elevate if not eradicate the crisis Egypt was facing regarding unsafe drinking water.
                        Chisisi decided to talk to the CEO of the company, Lasin inorder to transport 4,500 of the
                        purification machines to Egypt fully funded by the Egyptian government. The Egyptian government
                        in the past spent hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars trying to fix the drinking
                        water problem but until now, it remained as big a problem as it was at the start 20 years ago.
                        Chisisi had already made talks with Egypt&apos;s government to pay a 60% premium per unit for
                        the purifier. Chisisi told Lasin that the premium would be viable if the machines were
                        transported within 2 years. Lasin was delighted to hear the news, but currently the peak
                        production rate was less than 16 per week. At that rate it would take decades to fulfill the
                        demand. Lasin was not going to let the deal slip away like this. The deal could finance the
                        space endeavors of the company at least for a year. Lasin holded a meeting at his company. Every
                        high level executive was present at the company, from China and Nepal. The agenda of the meeting
                        was to do a massive technology transfer for China to Nepal to establish a large-scale
                        manufacturing plant of equal proportion to that of China&rsquo;s in Nepal&rsquo;s Bharatpur
                        district. Lasin chose Bharatpur because from a societal standpoint Bharatpur was a little more
                        organized than other districts of Nepal. The mayor of Bharatpur was a female who was the
                        daughter of the leader of the maoist movement. She was reelected for her amazing performance at
                        her first term. Since Bharatpur was connected to India, all existing trade routes if incase
                        necessary would suffice for transportation of purifiers from Nepal to neighboring regions of
                        India. Since India also had some problems regarding safe drinking water, the product of
                        Ytiralugnis could come in useful there. Technology transfer from China to Nepal was always
                        dreamed about by Nepali politicians but it could never be a reality in the past. Main hurdle
                        preventing this from happening was the virtually non existent supply chain of essential parts
                        vital for manufacturing in Nepal. Since Nepal didn&rsquo;t have an existing supply chain,
                        further expansion needed for more advanced product manufacturing was never on the roadmap.
                        Furthermore, Nepal didn&rsquo;t have the political stability needed for such large scale
                        endeavors in the past. Technological transfer in the past had been a major thing between large
                        nations like the US and UK who collaborated with each other to defeat the Germans. Now, in a
                        capitalist economy like any other, any country can join the global economic engine to gain upper
                        hand in producing improved technology. The meeting ended with an agreement between the two
                        parties representing the Nepal and China portion of the company&rsquo;s collaboration. Now the
                        only path for the company was forward. This deal had a long time coming. Signs of such a deal
                        taking place between Nepal and China were expected long before but due to the Nepali side
                        representing a fraction of the potential of the Chinese side, the collaboration almost always
                        proved unprofitable for the Chinese side. This caused the Chinese to not show any interest in
                        making such a big investment in Nepal even though it would&rsquo;ve massively strengthened the
                        diplomatic relation between the neighbors. It was the same with India, India even cared to put
                        blockades between Indo-Nepalese border to influence the election in Nepal. Nepal up until then
                        was a mouse trapped between two hungry cats. It was never able to steer its destiny. It was used
                        more as a diplomatic gun by one border nation against another than a friend. If Nepal advanced
                        its space capabilities, it sure seemed like a great time for the future Nepalese generation.
                        Lasin went straight back to his home after the meeting. He didn&rsquo;t have time for a partner
                        which he felt constantly missing everyday. Maybe it was the fact that he lived away from his
                        parents or his parents were uncaring. For any reason possible, he felt lonely sometimes and
                        longed for someone. Niban sometimes came to his house and talked with him but the talk mostly
                        focused on business and their company. A girl was really necessary for Lasin it seemed. Niban,
                        as it turned out, had a sweet girlfriend about whom he kept hidden from Lasin. Lasin found out
                        about this from one of his executives at the office. He kinda felt betrayed that his closest
                        friend kept such secrets from him. But if destiny had its way then surely one day Lasin would
                        find a girl of his dreams, even just in a dream. He never had a feeling for any girls in the
                        past. Maybe it was his psychological upbringing, but he always found himself slipping away when
                        he tried to talk with any girl. He cooked some rice for carbs, veggies for fiber and little meat
                        as protein. The meal turned out to be tasty but he was alone so he couldn&rsquo;t share the
                        feeling. He worked on some schematics for the new building that was going to be constructed in
                        the upcoming months for housing the manufacturing plant for purifiers.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Niban called Lasin early in the morning the next day to come to the office
                        early for some urgent discussion relating to hiring. The newly constructed plant required
                        massive hiring for positions such as financial officer, China correspondent, senior executives,
                        technical staff like software engineers, supply chain expert, QA officer and managerial
                        positions throughout the company&rsquo;s portfolio. The same day a girl from MilkyWay sent an
                        application to the company looking for a job as supply chain expert. The position offered two
                        seats but if a qualified person was in its role then he/she would suffice. The girl&rsquo;s CV
                        looked great and all so the hiring department of Ytiralugnis called her for an interview the
                        next day. Her name was Akitir. She took a logistics and equipment management course as her
                        specialization at MilkyWay. Her tone of speaking and presentation along with her aptitude for
                        seeing details in interviewers&rsquo; questions made her an easy hire. Lasin as the CEO
                        personally signed her company invitation and hired her the same day. Akitir was to take more
                        than just supply chain duties during her first few months at the company. She personally had to
                        handle the China-Nepal technology transfer that had been seen by the Nepali government as the
                        biggest mutual agreement in their diplomatic history. The deal carried a huge potential for the
                        Nepalese people and the government. Nepal quite possibly could be able to ride on the back of
                        China&rsquo;s 30 year miracle growth just by signing a deal between two companies overseen by
                        the governments of Nepal, China and Egypt.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c6">Chapter 6</a></h2>
                    <p>In the following months nothing as interesting as the signing of the deal happened but the work
                        was moving forward at astonishing pace. The Chinese company previously manufacturing the
                        purifiers by gathering the parts from the local supply chain had begun to assemble sample
                        purifiers right inside the factory located in Bharatpur. The factory was churning out 1 purifier
                        every 3 days which was quite behind the peak output of 33 units from the Chinese counterpart but
                        progress was progress nonetheless. &nbsp;It was necessary to keep this pace going ahead
                        otherwise the structure kept in place would wither away into dust if the wheels didn&rsquo;t
                        turn fast enough. So Lasin along with senior supply chain expert Akitir, there had been one more
                        supply chain manager added in the company after Akitir, were constantly looking after the steady
                        pace of parts coming in from China while simultaneously overseeing the factory&rsquo;s output
                        rate and not letting it fall below a threshold that was quite aggressive for a newly inaugurated
                        factory. This impressive and very hardcore managerial style of Akitir was been criticized by the
                        workers but she kept her style nonetheless. Lasin was quite impressed by the woman. Her strict
                        nature was moving the company forward and he was all for the company moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just like the roadmap by Akitir had laid out, the newly inaugurated company
                        was beginning to produce 4 units per week by the end of the third month. Niban was working with
                        the vice president of the company to increase ties with the Nepali government at the provincial
                        level to supply more purifiers at a higher rate. This Niban had thought would allow for the
                        financial growth of the company without relying too much on exports to Egypt which was proving
                        too costly regarding transportation. Never had Nepal done massive trade with African countries
                        so it was a very new thing for the relatively new government to handle. Policy bills were
                        constantly passed at the federal level to control and manage the trading. Niban was radiating
                        nervous energy at work since his actions had such a huge impact on the literal future of the
                        country. Nepal was quite probably leaping into the . In the coming months, the company was
                        seeing growth no other company in the world had seen before, the company was now employing more
                        than 10,000 workers at all levels of positions ranging from conveyor belt department to robotic
                        assembly department. The company was now producing products ranging from children tiffin boxes
                        to rice cookers, induction cooktop, water heaters, air conditioner, water pump, car carburetors,
                        silencer pipes for motorbikes and was even in the talks to license honda&rsquo;s bike engine
                        schematic to develop and manufacture 200 cc engines in Nepal. This was an unheard rate of growth
                        for any company in the history of humanity. Samsung, Tata, Apple and even Tesla, none had come
                        close to achieving this scale of industrialization at such a short period of time. All within a
                        year, Ytiralugnis went from being a trademark to manufacturing most of the Nepali
                        households&rsquo; machines and selling at a much affordable cost than rival India, China was
                        still providing value tho but sooner or later the Nepali government would increase the import
                        tax thereby rendering all import trade from China useless. That was a long time prospect tho.
                        China was still by far the most impressive manufacturer when it came to highly sophisticated
                        products such as laptops, cameras, phones etc. And quite frankly, Nepal was not expected by
                        anybody to increase import tax on those essential products it was far from producing locally.
                        Still there had been a big change, once Ytiralugnis products flooded the Nepali markets. People
                        began showing their inner patriotic desire however much they hated the country before by buying
                        only the products manufactured by Ytiralugnis and ignoring their Chinese counterparts. This was
                        the case with tiffin boxes to rice cookers. Everything Ytiralugnis was able to produce, people
                        preferred them over foreign made ones.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was very happy with the progress the company was making within 2 years
                        of inception. Apart from that, Lasin was lucky to have a great executive team capable of
                        handling all sorts of problems the company faced during its arduous first year. Akitir was the
                        company&rsquo;s best hire till date and it had hired lots after her. She was one of the first
                        hires and turned out to be the most valuable human asset of the company. The supply chain
                        handling was the most difficult and demanding job in the entire company and Akitir handled it
                        perfectly. Now the parts required for manufacturing were continuously arriving from China and
                        virtually all problems in the supply chain were fixed. Nepal was even in talks with China
                        regarding the construction of a cargo railway line joining Shenzhen to Bharatpur. This would act
                        like a major vein connecting the two countries like a blood vein connecting different parts of
                        the human body. Since all was moving forwards nicely, it was time for Lasin to focus on his big
                        goal, construction of a space launch complex. The daunting task of constructing and financing a
                        massive endeavor like this that seemed impossible before now seemed quite an easy task. It was
                        December again. The cold morning breeze that flowed from Lasin&rsquo;s windows chilled his skin
                        again causing the hairs on them to jerk and straighten sharply. The feeling was the same as last
                        time, something had to be done. Something to change the face of the country. Make something
                        deemed impossible happen and happen right in his hand. He was the CEO of the world&apos;s 8th
                        largest manufacturing company, calculated by product categories in several categories. He was
                        not complacent. He always got that little push that pushed him no matter how near he stood to
                        the edge. The cliff if it had to take him would take him, but he needed to check. Would the
                        cliff instead turn upside down and face him like a mountainous obstacle to climb or suck him in
                        its darkest depth like a blackhole never losing grip on his mind sending him into eternal limbo.
                        He had to check. Now was the time, now or never. Make a space center and hand it over to the
                        future generation of his country. The possibility of children being able to witness fiery
                        rockets climbing into the vast expanse of space representing endless possibilities was too hard
                        to ignore for him. He, as a child, wished he had been born into a later generation, to have been
                        able to witness the future with his own eyes instead of the yet unseeded micro DNA in his
                        genome, but at least he could do it even if his ancestors didn&rsquo;t care to. He would change
                        the lives of his children, he would give them hope, make the tales of dragon climbing skies in
                        their story books a reality they would be able to see using highly advanced technology, the ones
                        a person picked from the middle ages would be unable to distinguish from literal magic and
                        remain slack jawed with water drooling from his mouth. This was the promise of technology he
                        thought. A possibility, nothing else, a possibility to conjure arcane forms of magic and control
                        it instead of letting it loose, controlling to benefit all who were alive, not just the conjurer
                        with his selfish mind. A culture shifting phenomenon that came once in a hundred thousand years
                        in the history of a civilization, he had the possibility to do it even just a 1% chance. That
                        chance was too far-reaching to ignore.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin had not gone on a long vacation like he used to go on during his college
                        years. The thrill was pulling him so he decided to take the top executive team at his company on
                        a long vacation to Europe. Europe had a long and ancient history that brought almost all of the
                        modern civilization into existence. The popular phrase &lsquo;Western Culture&rsquo; derived
                        itself from the extraordinary shift in the western populous&rsquo; mind that led to the
                        renaissance and democratic reforms throughout the land. The trip had been planned to include a
                        ship cruise from Norway to Denmark and stay in Copenhagen, the city that gave its namesake to an
                        interpretation of the quantum mechanical wave function collapse. Ytiralugnis had a quantum
                        mechanics department that specialized in researching the future of the company in the field of
                        quantum computing. They arrived at Copenhagen after a long cruise from Norway, the sights they
                        saw during their travels made them connect with the beauty of nature rather than its horrors.
                        Nature itself may not have been fully responsible for the horrors it mindlessly created by
                        creating minds. The minds in the ship were now looking back at nature admiring it for its beauty
                        but Lasin wanted the crew to see the both sides of nature, how nature was able to create hell
                        without intending to. This was always the problem with evolutionary design. A random design may
                        not produce anything quantitative but then randomness got removed and further and further
                        complexity became introduced in the design which led to the creation of unexpected things. In
                        the case of the universe, it was the atoms coalescing to form molecules. They could&rsquo;ve
                        stopped at that point but due to selection operating at some level caused molecules that
                        didn&rsquo;t coalesce to form bigger substances to get eliminated leading to the further chain
                        reasoning of atoms coalescing to form molecules coalescing to form substances coalescing to form
                        rocks giving rise to density giving rise to pressure giving rise to heat giving rise to fusion
                        giving rise to energy giving rise to Krebs cycle giving rise to cells which then combine with
                        other cells to form more complex cells giving rise to multi cells and then parallelly in an
                        alternate space, the Krebs cycle reversed taking advantage of photon, H2-O and C-O2 instead of
                        C-H molecules thereby giving rise to oxygenic photosynthesis giving rise to plants making food
                        for plant eaters which became food for meat eaters turning the entire prospect of energy
                        sequestration into a vicious tormenting cycle with the introduction of brains and consciousness.
                        If it was not for consciousness, the nature&rsquo;s beauty would remain hidden but so would the
                        torment every plant eater faced from meat eaters. Lasin saw the terrifying dichotomy in
                        nature&apos;s situation very clearly. He thought it extended to much bigger things, things like
                        the entire universe. Universes eating universes might be a reality he suspected. If it was not
                        for anybody to stop anything bad happening, then surely the thing must happen no matter how
                        wrong it would feel to a petty conscious being evolved by randomness itself to see the non
                        random element of itself discarding infinite senses and selecting for a handful because to much
                        would reintroduce the meaninglessness of randomness. Randomness too dangerous, randomness too
                        powerful, randomness too damaging to the fragile non random bubble bubbling out of a sea of
                        infinite jitter vibrating to nothing, vibrating for nothing, executing a seemingly endless dance
                        to the god of nothing, appeasing to no one, not even knowing it existed, true randomness, true
                        unimaginable hell, unknowable to the limited senses of a petty meat creature coming out it, to
                        do nothing, to die in an extinction, and if not extinction then sometime in the future, for
                        surely the randomness would clutch them since they themselves owed their existence to it, if not
                        even the universe was certain of itself, succumbing to the utter randomness of it all, then how
                        could petty meat creatures arising from within this hell?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin experienced these emotions whenever he saw the scintillating waves of
                        water, rocking movement of tree branches, and the sky itself. It represented no bound no matter
                        how far anybody went. These emotions he thought aroused from the molecules vibrating in his
                        brain to nothing, to no order. To Lasin, order was everything. He was handling a mega
                        corporation that was single handedly carrying an entire country on its back. To let go of order,
                        to let go of himself to these molecules adhering to different realm of laws, laws he
                        didn&rsquo;t understand was not an option. He would suppress these feelings every time they
                        arose but today, today was different, he was seeing nature&apos;s beauty on the external surface
                        but inside it, he always saw those molecules with no feelings vibrating, dancing the eternal
                        dance of randomness. Lasin feared randomness immensely. He as a business man wanted to hold the
                        future in his hands, predict every major turn of events, predict every major hurdles his company
                        would face, but he was afraid, afraid in the inside, on the outside, a layer of predictability,
                        but in the inside, the same sea of molecules dancing that eternal dance. The next stop was
                        Scotland. Scottish beauty and the culture there was irreplaceable. The trip ended with a great
                        sightseeing tour of the Scottish train journey. They saw humanity on that train ride, they saw
                        the culmination of it, they saw the entire human culture.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c7">Chapter 7</a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The quantum mechanics department of the company was focused on developing
                        solutions to the decoherence problem. In quantum computing, the major problem faced by companies
                        at that time was the instability of quantum molecules preventing them from executing
                        instructions like a classical computer. This problem was preventing the major quantum labs at
                        that time to develop a versatile quantum computer able to compete with the classical computers.
                        Niban had an idea, instead of figuring out the decoherent states and eliminating them one by one
                        by modifying the circuit, the model of the chip could be fed into a neural network that would
                        then optimize for eliminating such decoherences through reinforcement learning with the
                        application of Hebbian networks. Doing this successfully would mean producing a design for a
                        quantum computer that would not suffer from the previous anomalies preventing new breakthroughs
                        in the field. This was a genius idea because the advancements made in quantum computers made by
                        machine learning would also allow for better training of machine learning models using the
                        quantum computer itself. Since neural networks are black box machines i.e the details regarding
                        the intermediate states of training are unnecessary for the final product, quantum superposition
                        would greatly speed up the training process. Breakthroughs on top of breakthroughs would be
                        possible by this. Niban purchased a ticket to Australia, administered a visa within an hour and
                        flew to meet the current greatest quantum computing expert, Noah Richardson. Richardson had
                        developed a method for isolating two qubits in perfect superposition allowing for faster
                        computing than classical bits. This was not enough though, quantum computing would amount to
                        nothing if only two qubits were used. To greatly exceed performance of classical supercomputers,
                        at least a 1000 qubits minimum were necessary. Niban went to IBM&rsquo;s headquarters in the US
                        to discuss their latest quantum chip. The state of the art chip featured 78 perfectly entangled
                        qubits allowing for 2^78 simultaneous operations per quantum information exchange. The
                        information exchange part was vital, if the states of the qubits were observed nanoseconds
                        earlier than the end computation, the entire computation would be ruined due to quantum
                        information traveling back in time and disrupting the superposition. This peculiar time
                        traveling phenomena was caused by the delayed choice quantum eraser effect. Niban hoped this
                        problem would be solved by the time Ytiralugnis started to take contracts for building quantum
                        computers. Since it seemed so far away, he hoped giants like IBM and Google would come up with
                        some solution, but the lackluster progress in the field made him doubt the possibility of the
                        problem ever being solved. He was not losing hope though. He met with researchers at IBM&rsquo;s
                        quantum computing department and talked with the researchers there about the problems they were
                        facing. The main problem in all of the researchers&rsquo; minds was the scaling of qubits
                        without exponentially increasing power draw for keeping the qubits just above absolute zero
                        temperature. This heat management complication was stalling the progress in the field for nearly
                        two decades. It was finally time to do something about this issue, Niban thought. Niban booked a
                        ticket and travelled to England to meet with the Deepmind team. Deepmind was the leading AI
                        research company specializing in creating advanced solutions to solve life long problems in the
                        field of science and medicine by utilizing the immense potential of neural networks. If it was
                        anywhere Niban thought of finding the solution, it was Deepmind. He met with Deepmind&rsquo;s
                        CEO Simed Sibassah and chatted for over an hour discussing the yet not demonstrated ability of
                        AI to be useful in the field of quantum computing. Simed thought it was a difficult problem
                        compared to say protein folding due to the overall immaturity of the field. The idea of
                        harnessing the weird nature of quantum mechanics to vastly speed up computing was a recently
                        conceived idea and its &nbsp;potential hadn&rsquo;t been definitively proven.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Do you think you can do anything to change that? What about utilizing the latest in AI to
                        solve the lingering problem in the latest of computing? Do you consider it to be
                        possible?&rdquo; Niban told Simed.</p>
                    <p>Simed looked back at his eyes and said, &ldquo;Well nothing should be considered impossible but
                        you know the issue in figuring out the solution to the heat management problem using AI is the
                        inexperienced ness of the field regarding the design of physical systems. I mean AI is
                        definitely used nowadays to design physical systems, even microscopic ones like proteins but we
                        have no idea of how to transfer that to designing entire integrated systems even as complex as a
                        normal computer forget quantum. There are many parts and they all need to &lsquo;talk&rsquo; to
                        each other perfectly. How do we even model such a thing in a neural network? Neural networks
                        require a huge amount of data to work, that&rsquo;s how they make predictions and build a
                        comprehensive model of the data they are feeded. The issue with designing better quantum
                        computers using AI is that there is virtually no data whatsoever about making better quantum
                        computers because we haven&rsquo;t yet made one. AI cannot design things that don&apos;t exist,
                        it learns from things already existing to make more such things. I think your problem is
                        unsolvable with our current state of the art.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was enough, Niban understood that Deepmind had nothing to give on the
                        matter. He thought Deepmind was nearing the design of a general purpose AI capable of surpassing
                        the human mind in intelligence. With that amplified intelligence, the AI would have solved the
                        lingering problem in quantum computing. But he was wrong, Deepmind was nowhere near the cusp of
                        that AI breakthrough. He lost hope in others. He needed to do it himself! The next day after
                        returning back to Nepal, Niban broke up the quantum mechanics department of the company into two
                        parts, the AI research department with 70 percent of the original staff and the quantum research
                        department with the remaining 30 percent. One of the original member of the quantum mechanics
                        department came to Niban at his office and said,&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sir, why did you take such an action? What are you thinking of? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed
                        to focus on quantum computers? Why are we now dividing our staff into two departments?
                        Won&rsquo;t this splitting hamper our goals?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;No, of course not. The reason I did that was to focus our company on some more near term
                        business prospects like the creation of advanced AI instead of diverting too much funds towards
                        longer term plans. The executive team doesn&rsquo;t think quantum computers are going to happen
                        within the next 20 years so this seemed like a little too big of an investment for our company.
                        Splitting the department and diverting the majority of staff towards the new AI department will
                        help our company to really push towards its newly proposed ambition of creating general AI
                        within the next 10 years.&rdquo; Niban replied back.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Do we have an AI ambition now? What product are we going to create with it? Robots?&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>&ldquo;No, not robots. We haven&rsquo;t discussed that yet. Something more on the line of a
                        better and more efficient version of the products we already produce. &ldquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Why do we need to care about efficiency so much? Does it help in obtaining more profit?
                    </p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Of course it does, why else would we invest so much money into AI for building better
                        products if it doesn&rsquo;t profit us? The thing is by efficient I mean efficient for us to
                        produce, recycle as well as transport. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be so much better to reduce the
                        footprint of our state of the art purifiers from the size of a car to something that could fit
                        in a table? The price would remain unchanged but the profit for us and the convenience for our
                        customers would increase. Just think of it as we are no more adding an AI department to our
                        company to make robots than we are using robotic assembly lines to make new products. We are
                        just trying to think long term and AI is necessary for that. &rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but AI seems like such a money sucking venture. It doesn&rsquo;t really
                        suit us. Google yeah since they are a software company but us? We are consumer household goods
                        manufacturers, it doesn&rsquo;t really fit together.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Nah, don&rsquo;t worry, we are expanding our business. Soon we will make rockets!&rdquo;
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was busy along with Akitir handling the supply chain issues that
                        recently propped up due to sudden landslides at the mountainous region disrupting the
                        transportation of goods. The problem wasn&rsquo;t severe but it might turn sideways. Akitir
                        dispatched a team to the site to investigate the extent of damage the landslide had caused to
                        the roads. While waiting for communication several hours later, it was found that the road
                        collapsed under the weight of soil thereby jamming the route. Akitir was frustrated, she punched
                        her desk with a loud thud and turned towards Lasin.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;How come we overlooked this?&rdquo; she grunted.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Overlook what?&rdquo; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s monsoon in Nepal, the soil in the hilly regions is buckling under the strain.
                        Landslides were predictable in such conditions, yet we did nothing to prevent this mess with
                        hindsight.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have the hindsight dear.&rdquo; Lasin was addressing Akitir with more and
                        more intimate words since he was more comfortable with her now, he liked her and she liked him
                        too, &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t predict a landslide. It&rsquo;s completely random.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Oh, really? I thought you had this stunning ability to predict problems our company would
                        face in the future and prevent them with no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;No, sweetheart. You are getting this wrong. I am just predicting the reaction of the free
                        market upon us releasing a new product. The fluctuation of prices and its implication to the
                        economy. I am good at economics like my father, not at predicting natural disasters.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you about your talents right now. I am getting really
                        concerned about this monsoon. It&rsquo;s more vigorous than last year. It might cause even more
                        problems later. We have no time.&rdquo; She turned towards the door and left hurryingly.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was at his desk when he received a phone call. It was from Chisisi.
                        Africa was facing one of the worst droughts in history and water problems there were escalating.
                        Ytiralugnis was making very powerful water pumps that operated at much low electricity and could
                        pump water to more than a 100 miles. Chisisi knew this and thought he could use some pumps to
                        pump water from the Nile river and provide it to the villages in Egypt. Chisisi was also equally
                        fed up by the Egpytian government for its incompetence like Nepali citizens with Nepali
                        government in the past. He spoke first, &ldquo;Lasin, my man what&rsquo;s going on? How are you
                        doing? Long time no see.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good, relatively speaking. Nepal is facing the wrath of monsoon,
                        experiencing extensive flooding across lands and several hilly roads are succumbing to
                        landslides. Landslides are havocking the critical road infrastructure we were using for trade
                        with China. Now, it&rsquo;s all almost stopped. Mud carried by water logging the factory gates,
                        it&rsquo;s all a mess right caused by too much rainfall.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You are experiencing problems due to too much rainfall while we are experiencing problems
                        due to too little. It really is a strange world we live in. Why isn&rsquo;t there balance in
                        nature? Right now, millions of Africans are thirsty for water and thousands are perishing daily.
                        If we could provide only a drop of water for each mouth, the ones that are dying could live for
                        another day.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Really? Is the situation that bad? Nature can really kill both ways. I think its really
                        upon us to balance the distribution of energy.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You are correct. So I&rsquo;m here asking the technology master for some solution. Will
                        pumps fix the problem?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Rudimentary pumps would fix the problem, but there&rsquo;s an even better idea. Instead of
                        using pumps to continuously supply water from the Nile, we can use loads of trucks to bring
                        water to the necessary areas without building any pipeline infrastructures for pumping. This
                        would solve the issue of time. Since we don&rsquo;t have much time for construction, we rather
                        go ahead with my idea and discard the pumps.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;How would we go on like this indefinitely, surely you can&rsquo;t have trucks bringing
                        water day in and day out.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the purifiers come in place. Purifiers will purify all the waste water
                        coming from cooking, bathing, cleaning and recycle it for round too. We have the best purifiers
                        in the world by a huge margin. It&rsquo;s what our company excels most at compared to
                        others.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Can those purifiers purify urine?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;They can purify H2O out of anything, whether it be chemical sludges, feces, gas, anything.
                        They rock!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Lasin. It was a really insightful talk. I will urge the government to
                        immediately dispatch the purifiers we have in stock as well as ask for water trucks to haul
                        water from the Nile. It&rsquo;s surely going to work, I know.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;By the way, if you don&rsquo;t have enough purifiers left from our previous exchange, we
                        can dispatch an airbus transporter carrying 200 units immediately. Do you need them?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine I guess if you want to but we have almost all the purifiers left from our
                        previous exchange. They were to be distributed to the South next week but after the drought, the
                        North desert will be prioritized now.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They ended their call. Chisisi felt very happy with the solution Lasin
                        offered. He admired Lasin&rsquo;s thinking style. It was more practical oriented than his
                        administrative friends&rsquo; thinking. Egypt was going to bounce back from the calamity,
                        Chisisi felt it in his heart.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c8">Chapter 8</a></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From famine and death, higher animals were produced, now they might produce
                        other forms of life, some in the same vein of biology but many beyond it, beyond the shackles of
                        evolution, free to grow, not limited by hunger, no fear of predators, unwithering advancement
                        stoppable only by the universe itself, but the universe didn&rsquo;t desire anything, only the
                        minds of those higher animals desired anything at all, and they didn&rsquo;t stop since they
                        were themselves forged into what they were by the ruthlessness of nature over eons.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin woke up early that day. He was in a good mood. Maybe the day was
                        bringing something new and unexpected and his brain was unconsciously preparing him for it by
                        releasing secretions of hormones carefully tuned to give rise to continuous bliss in his mind.
                        He prepared coffee, toasted some bread, took it out a little late this time for more crunchiness
                        and sat down at his desk. Lasin was a sentimental guy. He cared about others and others also
                        seemed to care about him. He was growing more and closer to Akitir. She stayed 3 kilometers far
                        from him in Bhaktapur district. Her commute involved traveling by bus. Nearly all buses in
                        Kathmandu had gone electric by that time. The mayor of Kathmandu did not advocate for a metro
                        which he thought did not suit the distinct ancient woody style of the place. That was a bluff.
                        Kathmandu although contained the word &lsquo;wood&rsquo; in its title, the place itself was
                        composed mainly of concrete and bricks. Some historical places still contained wooden structures
                        especially in Bhaktapur where Akitir lived but in other places, it was like any other city. The
                        mayor wanted the city layout to follow a grid system but the public hadn&rsquo;t agreed for
                        their houses to be demolished for free. Incorporating a grid system on top of a land was
                        relatively easy and straightforward were it not for the expensive houses built on top of it. By
                        translating a plot of land where roads were curvy, houses built randomly, into another layout
                        without losing the homomorphism, a mathematical term used to describe one to one mapping of
                        points from one set to another set, it was possible to completely transform the random layout of
                        Kathmandu to a perfect grid. The problem arose when the houses were priced at much higher, the
                        reason being the economic condition of Nepal than the market price reasonable for developers to
                        buy out in order to resell them in bulk to their original owners at a 14% premium. This
                        didn&apos;t happen and Kathmandu had remained the same since the last 100 years, an unorganized
                        mess of one traffic cutting in front of another, mixing public and private real estate,
                        businesses running on parking lots etc. It seemed unfixable until Lasin spoke to the mayor a
                        month before where he outlined exactly what radical thing needed to be done to transform
                        Kathmandu&rsquo;s city into something like New York&apos;s perfect grid. The idea again was to
                        use technology and one that was unheard of before. Each house that was out of alignment to the
                        translated grid layout by more than 76%, 76 because it matched computer simulations regarding
                        cost and efficiency, was to be marked as needing unearthing. The houses that fell below 76%
                        alignment ratio with the grid were marked as needing gyration. Unearthing and gyration both
                        combined would transport and place each house of Kathmandu that was structurally strong in the
                        exact spot on the new grid. The mayor started to speak,</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Gyrating? Unearthing? What is unearthing? Digging a hole of some kind?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Unearthing means cutting around the perimeter of the house up to the depth of its
                        foundation in order for the house to be hoisted upwards by crane for transportation. Gyrating
                        simply means not digging to the depth of the entire foundation but sufficiently close to extrude
                        its sides so that the house itself could be rotated to align with the grid.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t I heard these terms till now? I&rsquo;m a civil engineer god damn
                        it!&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because these methods were never used in practice, so no need to teach
                        engineers something that was unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So you want to use these obscure methods no one has ever tried before to remodel Kathmandu
                        literally from the ground up. If let&rsquo;s say we agreed to do this, what are the failure
                        cases? The biggest point of failure would be houses being too old to withstand the strain
                        exerted by the crane during lifting. It would mean the house crumbling structurally and making
                        it unsafe for living. But with utmost precaution and careful inspection beforehand, we can
                        eliminate the houses found too fragile for unearthing.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Wow, okay. If you are the one saying it&rsquo;s possible than who am I to say no. You are
                        literally planning on launching a 30 storey size rocket from Nepal into space soon. What was the
                        name of that rocket again?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called Eon, previously it was called Epoch but I didn&rsquo;t really like it so
                        I changed it to Eon. It also acts as an homage to Elon for changing the space industry for
                        private companies.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I think we can collaborate on your grand visions, Lasin, from reshaping Kathmandu to
                        launching rockets. It&apos;s really great for the country that it has people like you. We
                        don&rsquo;t really deserve individuals like you to be honest. The politicians apart from young
                        ones have been ruining our country from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The two left each other after some time. The reaction of the mayor certainly gave Lasin some hope
                        regarding the situation of housing in Kathmandu. Now, he was only left to do the things he
                        promised. The company&rsquo;s hands on webinar meeting of the third trimester with international
                        organization was about to be conducted. Lasin made some detailed proposals to Krupiński Cranes
                        company of Poland asking for building new cranes that were able to lift objects matching the
                        size and weight of Kathmandu&rsquo;s houses. Krupiński Cranes was the leading crane manufacturer
                        of Poland. Ytiralugnis had good cooperation with Poland through their cooperation in alleviating
                        the smog problem Poland was facing 6 months ago. The plan was to send the design and
                        specifications of the cranes to Poland for directly manufacturing and transporting the parts of
                        the disassembled cranes to Nepal. It would take a few months but Lasin could wait.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The AI research department was facing problems with accessing GPUs in the
                        Azure cloud for training their models. They were asking if it was possible for Ytiralugnis to
                        build a supercomputer to train their models in house without going through the hurdle of
                        uploading their massive model sizes to Azure cloud. Nepal didn&rsquo;t yet have a high speed
                        internet service of 1 gbps like other countries. Many houses in Kathmandu still used the slow
                        and unresponsive cellular data for browsing the internet. The main internet traffic was social
                        media. People in Nepal were addicted to scrolling down the endless social media feeds simply
                        because it required no mind whatsoever. The most addicting forms of those social media, namely
                        short video forms, were occupying the most traffic. Netflix and streaming services were
                        non-existent in Nepal due to the barriers in international monetary payment. Lasin was also
                        frustrated with the slow internet speeds, he wanted to do something about it. The month before
                        he implemented point to point fiber connection directly from the company to India&rsquo;s
                        leading internet service provider. But due to the nature of the internet, it was unreliable most
                        of the time. He was thinking about laying underground internet wire and connecting Nepal to the
                        sea. That got nowhere due to lots of bureaucratic hurdles involved in digging another
                        country&rsquo;s land. During all this, the AI department was the one most affected by it. AI if
                        done correctly could change the face of the company as well as the whole country but it required
                        massive investments in time, money and talent. The talent part was the most lacking. If somehow
                        Lasin and the executive team agreed with building their own inhouse supercomputer focusing on
                        executing matrix operations in ultra fast speeds, the human resource involved in designing and
                        building that would be massive. They would need to go on a massive hiring frenzy to acquire all
                        the people from all the skill sets required in designing, building and testing the
                        supercomputer. Nepal never had a supercomputer before so it would be the first in Nepal&rsquo;s
                        history and first always came with challenges. Challenges that could take years to overcome.
                        Lasin wasn&rsquo;t sure if the company was ready for such a massive project. It could even make
                        them bankrupt if it flopped although that was very unlikely. The problem with AI was that it
                        required massive computational resources during training and virtually none in comparison during
                        inferencing. This problem could be solved one day with the application of so called neuromorphic
                        computing but that seemed far off. Right now Lasin had no choice but to fund and execute a
                        large-scale supercomputer building effort in order to secure the company&rsquo;s future amid
                        continuous market disruption due to new technologies being introduced through AI application
                        daily.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akitir was supposed to handle the crane transport from Poland to Nepal. It
                        was a damn difficult job since Nepal had no access to sea and transporting such a massive
                        machinery by air was impossible by contemporary airplanes. Lasin gave this job to her since she
                        was great at accomplishing difficult jobs in an impressive manner. Lasin was sometimes surprised
                        by her ability. The initial parts of the first of the massive cranes Krupinski was building on
                        Lasin&rsquo;s order had begun to arrive two months after the agreement. They arrived by sea
                        passing through the Suez canal and were offloaded onto the Kandla port in Gujarat, India. From
                        there, there were two options. One was to transport the parts by train and the other was to use
                        18 wheeler trucks. The train method turned out to be difficult and arduous so Akitir decided to
                        use trucks. The trucks that were to transport the crane in its entirety once transported rockets
                        built by ISRO. They cost a lot more than expected but with nearly unlimited funds the company
                        had through its massive revenue generation, it wasn&rsquo;t something Akitir had to worry about.
                        3 weeks and 2 days later, the first crane in its entirety had arrived at Sunauli. From there it
                        entered Nepal. The longest duration of waiting was at the border due to customs and taxes
                        procedure. The process took a long time and it was very tedious. After finally finishing the
                        paperwork, the truck, an 18 wheeler one divided into three parts (front engine section, middle
                        supporting section and end supporting section) began rolling on the Bhairahawa-Chauraha highway.
                        The highway had been expanded into a 6 lane one in the past so it was relatively easy for the
                        truck to pass by without obstructing much of the traffic. It wasn&rsquo;t the case after that
                        though. The biggest problem Nepal faced with industrialization on a massive scale was the
                        unreliable roads of the country. They didn&rsquo;t allow for big machines to pass safely and
                        quickly. It was required to block entire sections of the Bardaghat hilly road to allow a single
                        cement mixer to pass through. The fast tract that was being built by the government was expected
                        to fix these issues but right now there was no other way but to do things the old difficult way.
                        The truck started on the east west highway after taking a turn at the Chauraha roundabout
                        arriving at the Bardaghat section shortly. There it faced immense difficulty in passing through
                        the narrow winding roads. It caused a massive traffic jam for 19 hours. Even after making it
                        through that section, the roads ahead were even worse. The Butwal Narayanghat road was nowhere
                        near completion and there were huge potholes covering every part of the road. The truck had to
                        wait before each pothole and men had to cover up each and every pothole with concrete slabs and
                        bricks to make it able to withstand the massive weight of the truck passing by. This madness
                        continued all the way to Chitwan, Bharatpur where it arrived days later when in reality the
                        distance was less than two hours by unobstructed travel. The company was located in Bharatpur
                        and seeing the difficulty the transporter was facing, it offered a solution. Instead of using a
                        long horizontal carrier, the crane could be folded on top of it and that would make it easier
                        for the truck to pass by the mountainous roads. They did that, the crane was folded on itself
                        and the rear section of the truck was removed. This made it much easier for the truck to take
                        turns altho it became much slower due to the increase in the height of the center of gravity. It
                        was a genius solution nonetheless. It took hours to do the fixing but took days away from the
                        journey. The truck arrived at Kathmandu passing from the Naubise checkpoint and arriving at
                        Thankot shortly after. There it faced other difficulties with regards to traffic since Kathmandu
                        was much more populated than any other city the truck had to pass by. Anyways, the final
                        destination of the crane was somewhere in the Kalanki region where there was a temporary land
                        emptied for housing the crane until operation. The entire journey took more than 2 weeks after
                        arriving at Sunauli border. The transportation part was finished at least for the first crane
                        Krupinski had sent, now it only remained to do the near impossible, transporting houses.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was happy with how the crane was able to arrive at Kathmandu. He gave
                        the props to Akitir. Lasin and Niban chartered a plane from Bharatpur and arrived at Kathmandu
                        themselves. They entered the mayor&apos;s room at Kathmandu municipality office. The mayor
                        welcomed and congratulated them on their accomplishment. The mayor spoke,</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So, you guys are capable of doing the impossible. I was quite surprised to see the massive
                        crane lying on the empty field the other day. How much does one of those cost?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It cost us somewhere around 33 crores per unit.&rdquo; Niban&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;33 crores is a massive sum. It&rsquo;s a lot of tax money.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah it is.&rdquo; Niban nodded</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the only one though. We are ordering 5 more. So make sure you get the
                        financing right.&rdquo; Lasin added.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about financing.The budget has already been passed. We are ready for
                        action now.&rdquo; the mayor assured them.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;The people will like you even more if you are able to sort out the traffic problem with
                        this.&rdquo; Lasin said.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I mean I hope it will be solved. Seeing how difficult the entire situation is here right
                        now, I think I am the most stressed mayor in the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, the grid system is proven to solve traffic issues at least by a big
                        margin if not completely.&rdquo; Niban assured the mayor.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So, preliminary work will begin tomorrow regarding the testing of the crane and also we
                        will begin surveying houses beginning with your locality if you quickly give us the permit. We
                        will summon the civil engineers from our company immediately after you are ready.&rdquo; Lasin
                        told the mayor.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure. We got the administrative side of the project. You worry about testing the
                        crane.&rdquo; the mayor said, smiling.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Sure, we are keeping our hopes on the good mayor.&rdquo; Lasin finished.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They left the office and stayed at a hotel that night. The dark sky of the
                        summer through with uncountable stars shone like little eyes gazing into earth, it felt as
                        though they were alive and watching every step Lasin took to change his country&rsquo;s face.
                        They went to bed early at 8 o&rsquo;clock. While they were sleeping in a deep slumber, the city
                        was not. The mayor was furiously talking with local ward chiefs over the phone informing them of
                        what was going to be done to their communities&apos; houses in the coming months. On the other
                        side of the city, in Kalanki, the mechanical and electrical engineers of Ytiralugnis were
                        closely inspecting the crane checking for any defects it might have gotten during
                        transportation. In Bharatpur, a meeting just concluded discussing the company&rsquo;s part in
                        the reshaping of Kathmandu. During the meeting, civil engineers were the primary focus. They had
                        to do the inspection and survey of each and every house in Kathmandu city and do a feasibility
                        study. They had to mark the houses that were ready for the unearthing and reconsider the
                        remaining unmarked ones. After that, all the pistons would fire and the project would gain full
                        speed. The slow part was at the beginning with surveying the houses and import of the remaining
                        cranes carrying on simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin never felt this energetic in the morning. He was ready to roll. With
                        all the blocks in place, he had to make sure there wasn&rsquo;t any unexpected problem propping
                        up at the later phase. He tried thinking of all the problems the project might face. He could
                        find none. Niban also couldn&rsquo;t think of any. They were complacent with their actions.
                        Nothing to add, nothing to improve, at least for now. Lasin and Niban went to the restaurant
                        downstairs and fetched some bread omelets for breakfast. They found it very delicious. After
                        finishing their breakfast, they went back to their room, packed their things, called a taxi and
                        went to the Tribhuvan airport. They were to go to Poland.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kripinski&rsquo;s headquarters was located in Wroclaw. Their CEO, Wojciech
                        Budowski, a 32 year old mechanical engineer, founded the company in 1993. Poland was occupied by
                        the Soviet Union after 1940. The country had a large history. It was invaded by the Germans in
                        1939 which initiated the world war. Poland saw a massive economic boom after the establishment
                        of the European Union. The massive industrial growth required the production of machines and
                        factories. Metal industry was booming in Poland in the post war days. This led to the massive
                        production of steel, cars, heavy duty vehicles etc. Kripinski inherited one of the steel
                        factories of Poland which had been out of operation due to the original company facing financial
                        problems. This cheap acquisition put Kripinski at an advantage.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin and Niban arrived at Kripinski&rsquo;s headquarters to meet with its
                        CEO. Wojciech arrived at the meeting room shortly after and started to talk,</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;So, how do you like the crane we sent you?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty good. We are satisfied. We would like to continue with our deal.&rdquo;
                        Lasin told Wojciech.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice to hear. You can see the remaining cranes in the production line right
                        there. Two of them are scheduled to be finished this week.&rdquo; Wojciech added.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Actually we are not worried about the schedule. We are here to discuss something much more
                        important. We ordered those cranes not for some building construction. We ordered those cranes
                        because we want to transport huge concrete houses using them. We have no experience doing that.
                        We&rsquo;d love it if you could help us.&rdquo; Lasin said.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;What? You ordered those cranes for lifting houses? I&rsquo;ve never seen cranes doing
                        that. Only seen rollers being used to move houses.&rdquo; Wojciech answered with a shocked face.
                    </p>
                    <p>&ldquo;We know about rollers but rollers won&rsquo;t help an iota in our case. The houses are
                        stacked side by side like books in a library. No space to move them using rollers. We have to
                        literally pluck them out of the sky and place them at the new place.&rdquo; Niban said with an
                        explanative gesture.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Alright alright, but then we have not done anything like that before, so what are we
                        supposed to help you with?&rdquo; Wojciech asked.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You need to give us the best talent in your company until this project is finished.&rdquo;
                        Lasin replied.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;A human resource transfer? But why would we do that?&rdquo; Wojciech asked with surprised
                        face.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Because we would give the credit of our accomplishment to you. Your stocks would sky
                        rocket because of the press gathering around such a huge undertaking. You would make money and
                        we would fix our city. Profit for both.&rdquo; Niban said smilingly.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Look I can&rsquo;t do that okay. I don&rsquo;t care about stocks. I can&rsquo;t give my
                        Polish employees to you. They are my asset. Anything happens to them and I would be the one to
                        blame.&rdquo; Wojciech replied back.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Look, we have the best employee security in our company. We will take care of your
                        employees. Nothing will happen to them, rest assured.&rdquo; Lasin told Wojciech.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I need to discuss this with the board. Call me sometime later.&rdquo; Wojciech said.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin and Niban left the office and went to Warsaw, the capital of Poland.
                        There they explored Polish culture. The architecture, language, food, rituals, traditions all
                        were very new to them. They attended a museum to see artifacts from Poland. They ate delicious
                        pierogi at a fast food restaurant. All in all, they loved Poland. They wanted their country too
                        to become as rich as Poland in culture.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c9">Chapter 9</a></h2>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akitir met with the new Polish friends who came back from Poland with
                            Lasin and Niban. She found them to be taller, whiter and generally more handsome than
                            Nepalese. She talked with one of them named Michal. Michal was a mechanical engineer and
                            crane expert. He had extensive knowledge regarding rigging complex structures on crane
                            ropes.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The general procedure to lift a heavy object,&rdquo; he explained to Akitir, &ldquo;
                            is to use more than one crane. And again, the more the cranes, the harder the problem of
                            rigging becomes. You have to continuously adjust the crane&rsquo;s attachment points as the
                            center of gravity shifts during the lifting of a dynamic object. You have to simultaneously
                            adjust the heights of the multiple cranes and make sure none of the ropes snaps.&rdquo;
                            Akitir was fascinated by these insights. She never knew a simple task of operating a crane
                            involved so much complexity.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next several days, the 10 employees of Kripinski outlined the
                            detailed procedure for digging, rigging, lifting, rotating and replacing the houses on the
                            ground. All of this involved roughly a whole day for each house. They visited several
                            locales and inspected the houses. They looked weak and earthquake prone. It was the case
                            with the majority of the houses. Lifting them with a crane would surely impact their
                            structure. But, nonetheless they verified the marking of the houses done by the civil
                            engineers and gave the ok signal to begin the procedure. Now, it was time for some action.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The &nbsp;mayor of Kathmandu gave the permit of operation for 4 locales each of
                            them consisting 10 to 16 houses, to Lasin. Lasin looked at the permits and thanked the
                            mayor. He presented the permits to the company&rsquo;s project manager. The work could begin
                            as soon as the next month with the arrival of a second crane. Two cranes would be sufficient
                            for lifting houses with relatively low weight.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crane was attached and tested thoroughly. Its boom was raised and
                            lowered, ropes extended and retracted and everything seemed to work perfectly. The second
                            crane was expected to arrive next week. The lifting part was taken care of. Now the
                            unearthing part was necessary to be looked upon. The dozers the municipality had would be
                            enough for the digging, Lasin thought. If it was necessary for some more advanced JCBs and
                            digging machines, then he would order them from China and transport them through the
                            existing supply chain.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michal was at the crane site along with Lasin and Akitir. Lasin
                            couldn&rsquo;t help but notice them two talking constantly. He was angered. He loved Akitir,
                            that was a fact. Now this polish guy out of nowhere seemed to irritate him. He stepped aside
                            and went to the toilet. While he was returning back to the field, he didn&rsquo;t see Michal
                            and Akitir. He was furious. He called Akitir and summoned her. He asked her reports and she
                            reported back unhesitatingly. But she wondered why Lasin was asking for her reports in the
                            middle of the day outside the office. Then she smiled and touched his cheeks, &ldquo;I love
                            you.&rdquo; she said. Lasin was dumbfounded. He wasn&rsquo;t expecting this here, neither
                            was he expecting this anywhere else. He was barely able to reply back,&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I love you too, Akitir.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Come to my room for dinner tonight.&rdquo; Lasin was not expecting this. He never got
                            such an invitation from her before.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Ahhh&hellip; sure. Absolutely.&rdquo; He replied.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they parted. Lasin went inside the temporary tent office they had built in
                            the middle of the field. Niban was present there. They two talked about the project coming
                            in smoothly.of the field. Niban was present there. They two talked about the project coming
                            in smoothly. Aniba, the project director, was sitting with them. She was very good at what
                            she did. She took care of everything from managing the survey to crane construction details.
                            After some time, the three went to get lunch together. They ate some dumplings along with
                            Schezwan sauce. Aniba loved dumplings, in fact dumplings were very popular in Nepal.
                            Everybody liked them. They consisted of wheat flour dough cut into small pieces containing
                            meat or vegetable fillings inside them. They were steamed for uniform cooking. The taste
                            depended mostly on the filling. If the filling was good, the outside dough didn&rsquo;t
                            matter. Aniba was quick to eat all her dumplings then she stared at the other two with her
                            gazing eyes while they ate slowly, savoring each and every flavor. Aniba started,</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it good that we are doing so much? The general elections all over Nepal
                            are coming soon, if one of us stood up as a candidate, we should surely make it to the
                            parliament without doubt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than that. The human mind at the time of judgment doesn&rsquo;t think
                            clearly. It is easily manipulated through clever conditioning. If the other candidate goes
                            to one of the voters and talks to them nicely, then that would be enough to make that person
                            vote for him or her. Even an interaction like that in the past would have enough effect to
                            prevent them voting you. So, if sufficient candidates reached a majority of people,
                            let&rsquo;s say 40% of the populous, then we surely lost 30 to 35% of those moderate
                            supporters of ours. This would easily prevent us from swinging the election on our
                            side.&rdquo; Niban said while taking another momo dumpling from his plate.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Right now maybe, but once everyone sees houses being lifted off 20 to 30 meters in the
                            air, all over Kathmandu, then they would definitely remember that over someone talking to
                            them nicely in the past.&rdquo; Aniba replied back without any momo left in her plate to
                            pick up.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You know what, let us end this superficial discussion and focus on today&rsquo;s
                            agenda. What&rsquo;s the status report of the crane testing Aniba?&rdquo; Lasin said,
                            shifting his gaze from Niban towards Aniba sitting in front of him.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Um, the crane testing is 40% complete. Everything checks out at this moment. The
                            project will start as soon as the next crane arrives, barring any complications that may
                            arise in the future. Sir, I think we are going to be ready to test this crane on an actual
                            house model tomorrow. After that goes on smoothly, we can handover the project to the
                            government as soon as next month thereby freeing us from doing other things inside our
                            company.&rdquo; Aniba replied.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Sure, there&rsquo;s no hurry. There&rsquo;s nothing important going on at the company
                            right now. If there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s important to us, then it&rsquo;s this
                            right here. If we successfully demonstrate the plan then we will gain the trust of the
                            government and maybe, just maybe, involve the government in our space center plan.&rdquo;
                            Lasin told Aniba, &ldquo;So, let&rsquo;s get to work on tomorrow&apos;s agenda.&rdquo; he
                            finished. Then they all got up from their seats and walked back into the tent office.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akitir wasn&rsquo;t to be seen around the field. She left the field early
                            because she had something planned for Lasin that night. She got into her land rover and went
                            shopping for her first date night. She was 26 years old, so she had no problem with dresses
                            not suiting her. She for some reason liked Velvet dresses. The silky fee gave her warmth and
                            comfort around men, so it was definitely the perfect choice for her date.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was invited by Akitir for the night at her house. So he dressed
                            himself in a white shirt, a beautiful designer blazer he bought from a branded store since
                            funds wasn&rsquo;t the problem with Lasin, a black tie with the letters &lsquo;space the
                            final frontier&rsquo; engraved on it, loose jeans pant couriered from Italy, leather shoes,
                            strapped a rolex watch on his left hand, picked up his choice of Rayban sunglasses from the
                            cabinet, his phone obviously and got into the toyota fortuner waiting outside his hotel at
                            around 8 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. He arrived at Akitir&rsquo;s residence at around 8:
                            30, 10 minutes later than he expected due to the traffic congestion around Ratnapark road.
                            He stood in front of the door, knocked the handle a couple of times and after a few moments,
                            Akitir opened the door, appearing in front of him wearing a beautiful red velvet dress
                            extending up to her ankles. She smelled of Versace perfume which emanated from all over her
                            body. Her hair was beautifully styled into wavy threads curling around each other and
                            meeting at the back. She had applied shiny red lipstick on her lips which gave radiance to
                            her teeth when she smiled. A beautiful ruby colored pendant was sitting on her chest, woven
                            around the neck. Black eyelashes were shifting his gaze when he looked at her eyes. All of
                            this, he noticed in the first two seconds of him seeing her. Love was powerful he knew, but
                            it was something else entirely when he experienced it first hand. She holded his hand and
                            pulled him inside. She was gazing into his eyes as she made him sit on a chair by the dining
                            table. A perfect selection of the best date night jazz music was playing through the stereo.
                            She had dinner prepared specially adhering to his taste and likening. The 4 course meal was
                            served by one of the helping staff. An expensive bottle of the best Scotch red wine poured
                            into two glasses immediately after they sat. Lasin started,</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful night, isn&rsquo;t it&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It is, for sure, I am delighted to have you here tonight.&rdquo; she said as she
                            shifted her hands towards the wine glass sitting at her side of the table.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;My pleasure. Thankyou for the invitation.&rdquo; Lasin spoke as he lifted his wine
                            glass bringing it closer to her&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Cheers&rdquo;,</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Cheers.&rdquo; she said as they gently struck their glasses with each other and took a
                            sip each.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You know what, you are a really charming person,&rdquo; Akitir spoke, as she gazed
                            into his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dressed handsome tonight.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You too, I absolutely love your dress. You&rsquo;re so beautiful in that
                            velvet.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two talked with each other for sometime about their likes and
                            dislikes until finally dinner arrived. The main course consisted of grilled chicken escalope
                            with fresh salsa plus pan fried pork chops. Lasin took a piece and savored it, he was
                            feeling hungry so didn&rsquo;t care to wait for Akitir first. Akitir didn&rsquo;t take her
                            bite, instead she looked at Lasin intensely, she spoke,</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;You like it? I prepared it myself&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely delicious. My mouth is watering, you are a chef!&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Stop it, I tried my best though. I used to prepare my own tiffin when I was at
                            school.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two were eating and frequently shifting their gazes from their food
                            to each other, laughing at the sametime. Akitir pushed her foot a little forward inorder to
                            tease Lasin, Lasin grinned. After the meal was over, the final course, a dessert was served
                            for both of them. Lasin took his spoon and gently shaved a portion of the cake, took the
                            spoon towards Akitir and Akitir with her smiling face, opened her mouth and ate the dessert.
                            The two connected with each other at that moment. Akitir did the same, feeding a spoon of
                            her dessert to Lasin with her hand. In the warmth of the candlelight, the distant sound
                            waves of birds singing in the trees mixed with the romantic music booming through the
                            speakers, producing a melody that scintillated their ears, overcoming their emotions and
                            sending them into a depth of infinite fun, infinite love, infinite emotions. The two
                            couldn&rsquo;t hold any longer. They both stood up around the same time, came closer to each
                            other, grabbed each other, and kissed. They kissed for a minute, but the magic was starting
                            to fade, Akitir could hold it anymore, she grabbed Lasin by his chest and thrust him to the
                            bed. The room was temperature controlled so they could be naked and not be uncomfortable.
                            Infact, the house had the best temperature controlled bed room in all of Kathmandu, since it
                            used the most expensive air conditioning technology by Ytiralugnis. They had the most fun of
                            their lives that night, free to explore each other without any worries.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was morning already, Akitir woke up first, gently caressed Lasin chest
                            and went to get a shower. She was just coming out of the shower when Lasin woke up. He saw
                            her fair skin in the morning sun. She was beautiful. After waking up and showering himself,
                            Lasin made some coffee. Akitir had the best coffee beans on the planet, the coffee turned
                            out a bit strong. He was afraid she would dislike the bitterness, but she loved it. She
                            preferred strong coffee. They both were now mentally alert. Akitir&rsquo;s morning ritual
                            involved some reading and meditation. She was musically artistic. She had learned to play
                            guitar during her school years. She took an electric guitar and started to play it. She
                            played the song November Rain by the American band Gun&rsquo;s and Roses. She played it so
                            wonderfully that the amplifiers on the ceiling gave the illusion of them being in an actual
                            Gun&rsquo;s and Roses concert. Lasin fell in love with her all over again. Over the vast
                            landscape of the human civilization&rsquo;s empire, something resonated with Lasin about
                            love. He never experienced love before in the way he had that day. The human empire valued
                            love immensely, it was certain. Many books described love as something that two felt just
                            for each other. Love that was perfect, two people from far corners meeting each other and
                            getting into deep love, love at first sight, the perfect repentance between two individuals.
                            Lasin stared at the star spangled sky and decided to marry her someday, he wanted to make
                            sure it happened at any cost.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c10">Chapter 10</a></h2>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second crane finally arrived. The demonstration using the
                                original crane was fully successful. The team wanted to move forward quickly now with
                                the second crane in their hands. Lasin met with the mayor early that day. He wanted to
                                take the mayor&rsquo;s permission before demonstrating their process in the first
                                community. The mayor signed the necessary document, entered in his car and they both
                                left for Bafal tole where the cranes were ready in place for beginning the operation.
                                The first house to be lifted was an old house that had been occupying the street
                                road&rsquo;s edges. The sides of the houses were already dug up by the JCBs the previous
                                day. The foundation was weakened with the application of resonance earthquake inducers.
                                These machines worked by sending pulses of highly directed frequency at a particular
                                location to shake up the molecules, tearing apart any attachments and weakening the
                                structural rigidity of the area. This was a novel technology developed by a German
                                technology in the last decade. The rigging was complete by the time the mayor and Lasin
                                arrived at the location. Now all that was remaining was to lift the house and place it
                                exactly on the right spot in the grid. In the countdown of 10, the cranes were to lift
                                the house along with its foundation, the first of such lifts in a project never before
                                attempted by any other country for a large-scale reshaping of a city. This was a first
                                in many levels and as the countdown neared to 0, many records were set to be broken
                                right in front of Lasin&rsquo;s eyes, Lasin a visionary, never thought this day would
                                ever arrive during his lifetime but circumstances put him, an ordinary man from an
                                ordinary village, born to ordinary parent, incharge of the biggest step yet taken by the
                                whole nation to change its literal face, to reshape itself inline with the future, to
                                bring the future here. The house began to lift and with 8 minutes and 40 seconds, the
                                house was lifted to the peak height leaving an open space of 30 meters tall under it
                                where it used to sit before. Shortly after this, the house was then gently placed back
                                onto the ground where a matching intrusion was dug for the house, facing slightly right
                                and matching the box outline for that house on the grid map. Everybody was thrilled to
                                see it perfectly working. This procedure would now be carried on everywhere else in
                                Kathmandu city to manage the haphazard urban sprawl of houses over the past century.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The mayor thanked Lasin after the demonstration was done. Now, all that was
                                left for the company was to handover the project materials and cranes to the government
                                for the reshaping of the rest of the city.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The company&rsquo;s financial officer along with project director
                                Aniba were to take their payment from their government that week. The sum was disclosed
                                at somewhere between 20 arba Nepali rupees. This sum would&rsquo;ve been unheard of in
                                the past but right then, due to the economic miracle the country saw due to the boom in
                                the manufacturing sector, that kind of sum was now a routine financial transaction
                                inside the nation. The payment was retrieved the next day. Every party involved in the
                                project was happy. The Polish employees were given their compensation for working for
                                the company along with additional stock benefits. It looked like it couldn&rsquo;t have
                                gone any smoother. Lasin was happy with how everything turned out.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3 months of what was one of the smoothest projects ever carried out
                                by the Nepali government changed the face of many localities all over Kathmandu. If
                                anybody were to walk by the streets of Kathmandu, they could literally see houses hung
                                up in the sky. The sight was beautiful. The project was covered by many international
                                media. It garnered huge attention all over the world. Brazil was considering doing
                                something like that in their own country. That was a future prospect, Kathmandu though,
                                was transformed beyond recognition in just those three months. It was becoming more and
                                more smart city-like.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The water on the surface of Rara lake was shimmering in the blue
                                glittering light emanating from the sky, the glow of the stars in the evening sky
                                reflected back from the water and reached one of the boys in a boat. The detail was so
                                real, he could&rsquo;ve mistaken it for the real sky. In the past decade, the Rara lake
                                was nothing but a local picnic site. Over those next years, due to the influx of
                                tourists from all over the world, Nepal had experienced a massive boom in the popularity
                                and recognition of its most impressive travel venues. The Everest climbing frenzy that
                                first got started with the summit of the mountain by the British climber Edmund Hillary
                                and Nepalese Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay, was also pushing Nepal into the world stage in
                                terms. The natural beauty undoubtedly was Nepal&rsquo;s most precious gift, a gift that
                                couldn&rsquo;t simply be bought by money. Even the trillions of dollars that Arab
                                countries generated by the sales of oil couldn&rsquo; buy them oasis that they
                                didn&rsquo;t already have. Yes, they could build artificial havens for staying and
                                enjoying, but the vast landscape of snowy mountains and green hills, moss growing on the
                                walls of caves, waterfall streaming down the cliff of a tall gorge, water flowing down
                                the river bed of a valley, lakes located on top of mountains colored in blue and cold
                                like ice, these things were something few countries in the world possessed. Promise of
                                an architectural grandeur rivaling nature&apos;s creation was always made but never
                                realized. This wasn&rsquo;t achievable with bricks and concrete, it was only achievable
                                by the process nature was able to create but that wasn&rsquo;t something humans as much
                                intelligence and wit they possessed, could even consider doing. Humans built from top
                                down, meaning they first gathered all the materials, made them into shapes and connected
                                those shapes into larger, more complicated shapes. This process was not only inefficient
                                due to the inherent waste of time connecting those already built shapes but also
                                limited. They couldn&apos;t create without relying on more than 100 supply chains, in
                                case of a building ranging from iron girder supply to water pump to electric wiring
                                supply. Then they had to decorate the interior and redecorate whenever the previous one
                                was not to their liking. Every time they redecorated the interior, they wasted a lot by
                                dumping previous things and replacing them with more new items. Recycling the same old
                                interior to build it into a newer one was impossible for humans because they
                                couldn&rsquo;t reshape the items once they had been shaped once. The revolutionary
                                technology of bottom up building was never able to transfer from nature to humans. This
                                always put humans several steps behind nature when it came to manufacturing. Humans
                                relied on other human workers to manufacture goods for other humans, how more
                                inefficient could it get than that? Nature, when it had to create stuff like a new cell,
                                created it on the spot where it was required, not some faraway location where after
                                finishing producing, it would then get lodged into massive delivery trucks which would
                                then transport it to the required location wasting both time and energy. The reason for
                                this could also be the scale at which humans operated. The big scale of the human world
                                might have limited the use of small molecular manufacturing techniques that nature uses
                                simply because in a large space, many more such tiny machines would be required. But
                                this logic was a fallacy, more tiny molecules didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it would
                                require more materials, it simply meant that the expenditure of energy while making the
                                tiny machines themselves cost more energy than the top down approach. It couldn&rsquo;t
                                be further from the truth. Tiny nano machinery by their nature would not occupy space
                                more than the final product they were trying to manufacture. This is why nature
                                didn&rsquo;t use scaffolds for building, it used the tiny molecules as tiny bricks
                                combining themselves to form bigger shapes.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was excited to see humans going from top down manufacturing to
                                bottom up like nature. He wanted to speed up that transition so that abundance could
                                arrive sooner. With that in mind, the most idealistic step for him, he figured out,
                                would be to open a nanotechnology department at the company. This would attract
                                micro-particle researchers from academics and other general research labs focusing on
                                chemistry and molecular engineering and concentrate them together to work on a single
                                overarching goal of developing atomic precision manufacturing or in other words, atom by
                                atom manufacturing. This vision was dreamed by many scientists and futurists in the
                                preceding decades but no large-scale endeavor towards achieving it was ever taken. It
                                seemed, as though, Lasin with his position as a brilliant engineer and visionary would
                                at last usher in the revolution of nanotechnology and introduce it to the general world.
                                Since the job was very difficult, it required a lot more commitment at the company than
                                other projects thought of by the executives.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was inspired by many of his heroes. He was fully versed in
                                Greek mythology and its many tales of triumph. He read the finest works of brilliant
                                German and English literary geniuses. He was passionate about the science fiction of his
                                era. He read the writings of Asimov, Clarke, Banks and many more scifi geniuses.
                                &nbsp;He was a man of culture. He wanted those stories to become a reality. He also
                                believed that without doing anything, things would automatically improve but rather they
                                tended to get worse over time. If there was anything Lasin was confident about, it was
                                this.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However difficult the future projects Lasin dreamed of were, it was
                                unquestionable, what Lasin did with Nepal&rsquo;s first international conglomerate,
                                changed Nepal&rsquo;s destiny forever. Teh future for Nepal was nothing but bright. New
                                generation would learn about Lasin as the nation&rsquo;s hero and strive themselves to
                                do something big. This would create a chain reaction of innovative minds across the
                                country working on eliminating all the societal problems that had been engraved on the
                                people for centuries. The time for massive cultural change of the country was near.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c11">Chapter 11</a></h2>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;Vox Populi, Vox Dei&rsquo;, This was the backbone of
                                democracy. Democracy was the worst form of government except all the others that had
                                been tried before. If it was possible to improve it, it surely wasn&rsquo;t easy. Power
                                always led to corruption of soul, if democracy was replaced by anything that gave power
                                to a particular individual, it was doomed to create dictatorship. Nazi Germany was the
                                quintessential example of that. The country saw the rise of a powerful public figure who
                                promised to bring the country back from the destitute but instead led to even more
                                desperation with the loss of another World War and massive loss of lives. But democracy
                                wasn&rsquo;t efficient. It required massive effort to choose a new candidate and the
                                investment wasn&rsquo;t correctly utilized if the candidate the people chose
                                didn&rsquo;t turn out to be good. Democracy could easily turn from people&rsquo;s choice
                                to an autocratic system where the humans at the top of the power hierarchy could control
                                the system of law and order and snatch the power from the people. But there was not a
                                better one so people were stuck with democracy until a better system could be devised.
                                But how would that transition happen? Would it happen peacefully like choosing a new
                                president or would it require violence like the French revolution? In any case, the new
                                better method should prevail over democracy. Many thought the new system of governance
                                would be based on an artificial super intelligence that was benevolent. It was a
                                supposedly the most probable assortment given the fact that democracy required hundreds
                                of years to evolve into its modern form. If there was anything that could do it faster
                                say in decades, it was artificial intelligence of vastly more capable kind. The endgame
                                presented with regards to artificial intelligence that if it went horribly wrong, it
                                would enslave humanity and block further growth to minimize its chance of complete
                                dominance, occupied humanity&rsquo;s mind at the time. The alternative to artificial
                                intelligence was 100 or even 1000 more years of slow human cultural development without
                                any assistance to the populous&rsquo; mind. This slow and quite finicky process of
                                humans acquiring knowledge through happy accidents and lucky discoveries had prevailed
                                in the past due to no alternatives. But in an age of virtually nobody interested in
                                doing search on their own, the lucky accidents might not get the sufficient chance it
                                required for occuring. This could vastly slow down the development of humans. If humans
                                were to shift their thinking, then there would be no alternative but to literally shift
                                their thinking with the assistance of artificial minds. These non biological methods of
                                thinking were hard to construct. They required years and years of academic research to
                                get somewhere with the results. Google&rsquo;s translation feature used to use
                                statistical methods and algorithms for translation languages in the past. After not
                                seeing improvement, they switch to neural machine translation. This yielded better
                                results but nothing compared to a proficient interpreter. It unequivocally proved it was
                                much harder to house minds outside of the skull. So the skull was the thing that was
                                then challenged. Scientists probed the human mind using tweezers. They could infer the
                                electrical signaling patterns of the human mind and infer the neural correlates of the
                                human thought process. That then allowed them to design and build simulation of networks
                                inspired from that decoded neural patterns. These neural networks were known as Hebbian
                                networks. They worked by taking input on one side and producing the output on the other
                                side. It seemed to work like magic but later on as expectations grew, it failed to
                                produce tangible results that could be comparable with the general thinking of the human
                                mind. Neural networks were able to excel on one task but miserably failed on other
                                generalized tasks. A baby could infer things that the artificial mind struggled with.
                                With this in mind, the researchers probed even deeper into the skull. They found cells,
                                but that was no surprise. Everybody knew about cells since the early 18th century. The
                                surprising fact was that the cells contained tiny structures like cell nucleus, membrane
                                particles, microtubules etc. that although didn&rsquo;t seem to add to the neuron firing
                                process, distinguished the biological thinking from the artificial thinking. Nobody had
                                any inkling about what was happening with these cells that was causing them to act
                                differently than simple artificial switches. The transistor was no more different than
                                the neuron when it came to functionality but they were separated by the seemingly
                                insurmountable chasm between biology and normal materials. What was the thing that was
                                causing this phenomenon? Nobody could tell. But it was certainly caused by the billions
                                of years of independent evolution biology went through without the interference of an
                                intelligent mind. How would humans overcome this billions of years of advantage their
                                rival or ironically themselves had? This was vastly challenging that many considered.
                                The solution had a long history.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the year 2008, the artificial intelligence firm, Walker Omnipotent
                                Manufactured Brain labs abbreviated as WOMB labs embarked on a decade long journey
                                acquiring scientific minds that joined it to work on creating a working replica of the
                                human brain from non biological materials. They used plastic and metal obviously. They
                                came to the conclusion that the human body and by extension the human mind was made up
                                of the most abundant elements in the universe. This included hydrogen, oxygen, carbon
                                etc. The most manufactured items by humans were plastic and metal. They pioneered a
                                method of etching actual copper circuits on the surface of a plastic sheet. The plastic
                                had to be thin, soft and had to possess low specific heat capacity necessary for heating
                                and etching melted copper. The plastic sheet was then laid flat on the robotic printer
                                surface, where a finely guided tip with a hole punched in it blew out with the help of a
                                pressure feeding valve mechanism blowing pressurized air, molten copper stored inside an
                                insulating chamber storing molten copper produced by a ring induction heater where rods
                                of copper were passed. They used an intel chip to regulate the value opening and closing
                                mechanism. All in all, it required them 3 months to create this contraption from the
                                ground up. They could then layer plastic on top of another plastic to create a massive
                                block of stacked plastic layers. This acted as the substrate of the mind they were
                                envisioning of creating. It was very very primitive, nothing when compared to the real
                                mind. The lab was fine with it however. They didn&rsquo;t intended to compare their
                                stupid looking plastic junk with the real deal and become miserable and give up. They
                                intended to develop far more advanced and sophisticated technologies on top of that
                                which would then bring their mind replica which was then a plastic box closer and closer
                                to the human mind like an asymptote approaching closer and closer to a value but never
                                quite reaching it. Right then however, they had nothing but a fancy way to make PCBs and
                                a method to stack them which was a difficult process even in the late 2000&rsquo;s.
                                Armed with this, they were now free to add even more techniques to their arsenal to
                                improve the rudimentary brain substrate they had going on. The problem with building an
                                artificial mind substrate was the mind body problem. Even after building an artificial
                                substrate that was as close to the human brain, they couldn&rsquo;t be sure that it
                                wouldn&rsquo;t face the same old problems faced by the neural networks operating inside
                                a computer using software. If this problem was unbridgeable, their massive investment in
                                creating a brain replica would go in vain. This wasn&rsquo;t something they worried
                                about because they thought however difficult it was for this problem to be solved, it
                                wasn&rsquo;t unsolvable because nature had already solved it once and now nature&rsquo;s
                                children were going to solve it once more, just repeat what nature had already
                                accomplished millions of years ago.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The plastic contraption the company had built operated like nothing
                                more than a PCB. Electricity was used to transfer signals from one part of the PCB to
                                another part thereby loosely imitating the transfer of neuronal signals across one part
                                of the brain to another. They didn&rsquo;t use any chip to control the flow of signals.
                                If they did, they would be breaking one of the laws concerning the biological brain. In
                                a biological brain, no part of the whole brain was considered to be the center. Every
                                single part of the brain acted independently. This was in contrast with the general CPU
                                humans built. Inside a CPU, the flow of electrical signals was regulated by the clock
                                which sent pulses of electricity that flowed to the central part of the CPU first and
                                was then diverted to the other parts of the chip. Brain worked in a completely different
                                mechanism. Each and every connection generated their own electrical potential with the
                                help of mitochondria contained inside each cell. These neuronal cells then communicated
                                with other cells to produce firing patterns that correlated to the thinking process in
                                the mind.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next thing the company was thinking of adding to their plastic
                                sandwich was a sense organ. Well not a biological sense organ but a sensor created for
                                interfacing with computers. They couldn&rsquo;t just attach a sensor in some part of the
                                PCB board in one of the layers because there wasn&rsquo;t anywhere the signals from the
                                sensor could pass to. Generally, sensors communicated with a CPU which would then decode
                                the electrical signals and infer data about what the sensor was monitoring. But their
                                PCB sandwich didn&rsquo;t have a CPU. CPUs were to be avoided, they thought, if they
                                were to get rid of the problems the Hebbian neural networks faced. Otherwise, they would
                                retain the same problems. Biological brain definitely used sensors, which is why animals
                                could sense their surroundings and take actions that were contingent with it. But, how
                                on earth were sensors supposed to work on layers of copper circuits. If it were to be
                                supposed that one part of the sensor input should give rise to electrical signals in
                                some local part of the 3 dimensional PCB sandwich as output, and the complimentary rise
                                of those circuits gave rise to the output of the brain on some output device, it would
                                unambiguously complete the circle of energy flow in biological creatures. An animal had
                                to eat food that would then get converted into energy as ATP inside mitochondria located
                                inside cells as well as organic molecules to build the animal. This all happened at once
                                at the Krebs cycle which was the engine of cells, the main part of cell metabolization.
                                Some of the energy produced in the form of ATP would invariably be used at the brain
                                where sensors such as eyes connected. The photons striking at the eye cells would
                                transfer signal through the optic nerves which would then get amplified by the ATP at
                                brain and produced complimentary signals at the motor cortex of the brain which would
                                then once again transmit signals through another nerve to the output part i.e limbs and
                                muscles in turn moving them and thereby completing the cycle of energy in the human
                                brain and body. Same thing couldn&rsquo;t be said of their plastic sandwich because it
                                didn&rsquo;t have any mechanism of producing energy by itself. It had to be connected to
                                an outlet plug to get energy from the grid. The grid in turn wasn&rsquo;t able to
                                produce energy by itself using nothing but air, sunlight and rain. It relied on some
                                faraway electricity generator that produced electricity converting some other form of
                                energy mostly heat into electricity. The flow of energy acted less like a cycle and more
                                like a long chain of dependencies. The plastic sandwich would never be independent if it
                                didn&rsquo;t contain its own Krebs cycle cable of churning out energy when energy was
                                scarce and building materials when building materials was scarce. This was what biology
                                did. It used its own building materials to build itself. It didn&rsquo;t rely on third
                                party builders outside its system. It contained each and every part of the biological
                                construction suite within it.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So was the plastic sandwich capable of creating and growing itself,
                                provided a sufficient source of energy, like biological brains were? No where close.
                                Each layer had to be built separately and later on were stacked on top of each other to
                                create the 3 dimensional shape resembling the 3d shape of a biological brain. The
                                rudimentary plastic model wasn&rsquo;t able to create itself because by definition it
                                was rudimentary some might think. But that wasn&rsquo;t something important. Prions can
                                create replicas of themselves without relying on complex cellular manufacturing
                                machinery. They themselves are very simple but can multiply themselves thereby
                                satisfying the definition of creating and growing themselves. The PCB sandwich by itself
                                wasn&rsquo;t capable of adding new layers of PCB on top of it to make a bigger and
                                taller sandwich and &nbsp;thereby it couldn&apos;t grow itself. Whenever the sandwich
                                desired some new fresh thinking &nbsp;space by its own volition, it wasn&rsquo;t able to
                                create it. It had to depend on humans and so wasn&rsquo;t able to expand its capacity by
                                itself. That would definitely put some strain on its learning ability. So, what needed
                                to be done? First of all, definitely, addition of some form of self repair mechanism in
                                case a circuit breaks. They went through all of the discovered methods and technologies
                                but they found none that could repair PCB short circuits without human intervention.
                                Later they settled with something out of the box. Instead of designing circuits with
                                electricity conducting copper, they decided to use a self healing polymer chain to do
                                the job. Polymer materials when left to themselves underwent polymer chain reaction
                                which cause them to build on top of themselves. This was analogous to what DNA in
                                biology did but much less complex. Also, when a polymer chain was cut, the two
                                disconnected parts could be joined together by applying a little pressure. Metas
                                couldn&rsquo;t do that because they underwent oxidation reactions that immediately
                                prevented exposed surfaces to be free of external molecules.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But polymers cannot conduct electricity nearly as well as metals. So
                                how would the polymers communicate? This was solved by using a derivative variant of
                                self healing polymers known as conductive self healing polymers. These polymers could
                                conduct electricity but not as readily as metals. This would certainly limit the
                                computation speed of the mind substrate but they didn&rsquo;t really care about speed at
                                that time. Since they were trying to replicate the human brain in some ways, they were
                                fine with it. After some research, one of the researchers, Eredna Ednil, found a way to
                                mass manufacture these molecules by using super conductive hydrolysis, basically
                                electrolysis but with super conductive anode and cathode insead of the normal one. This
                                method fused carbon on top of carbons thereby increasing the speed of polymer synthesis
                                by a thousand fold than the previous method. Eredna wanted to implement this process as
                                soon as possible but she found another hurdle.</p>
                            <p>Superconducting materials at room temperature didn&rsquo;t exist and it would cost
                                millions of dollars to super conduct using vacuum cooling. They didn&rsquo;t have the
                                money. Based in Frankfurt, Germany, they could ask the Frankfurt science and technology
                                aid scheme to fund their project but it seemed like they needed more money than the
                                institute could provide. At last they settled with not building a superconducting
                                hydrolysis machinery and instead decided to rent the Frankfurt chemical labs machine to
                                produce their polymers. The lab worked by synthesizing 800 grams of polymer per customer
                                in a day. This was nowhere near the amount they would require to rapidly iterate their
                                brain designs. So they struck a deal with the lab. It would produce 2 kilograms of
                                polymers, which required 3 hours of time. At last, the team was on track to build a
                                brain that could self repair in case of circuit failure. They started by ordering a
                                preliminary 200 grams sample of the polymer. They laid the polymers exactly on top of
                                the spot where there was copper before. Then they fired a pulse. The pulse started at
                                one end of the circuit, traveled to the other end where it connected with one of the
                                pins of an LED light bulb, then emitted out the other end and in the process
                                illuminating the LED, went back to the pulse generator through the other polymer pathway
                                and restarted the cycle. The team was exhilarated, they knew they were onto something.
                                They repeated the process with all the PCB layers, removing the copper circuit that laid
                                before and replacing it with the polymer synthesized by the lab. No problem was detected
                                at this scale. But biology operated at much smaller scales. How would they scale this
                                method? Was it possible that there was some kind of Moore&rsquo;s law for polymer
                                circuits? Integrated circuits could be laser etched but it was a different playing field
                                with polymers. They would need to innovate from the bottom which would take a lot of
                                time. Maybe another 40 to 50 years like computers? But they didn&rsquo;t think that was
                                a possibility because even at that time, the majority of the populous knew that
                                technology was accelerating faster and faster which would undoubtedly lead to a rapture
                                at the end of the process. That rapture termed by many the singularity could well
                                accelerate the next 1 million years of slow innovation to mere centuries or the next
                                100,000 years to mere decades. That was all good but it was still theoretical that such
                                a rapture would happen, instead, many also believed that humans before heralding the
                                arrival of such rapture, would slip into degeneration due to the inability of them to
                                take control of powerful technologies. This was very much a possibility. The
                                incompetence of the unassisted human brain was pitiful. If any extinction level
                                technology was taken out of the urn as Bostrom would say, the humans would definitely
                                not be able to take possession of it. It would possess itself in many corners of the
                                world where people did their own things without anybody in the other corner. Those
                                people could deploy that extinction level technology on the advice of nobody and doom
                                the entire humanity. But suppose that didn&rsquo;t happen, many also believed that the
                                cursed human brain would not be able to accelerate technology evolution forever and
                                therefore not lead to any singularity. That could certainly happen since humans
                                certainly weren&rsquo;t machines, they required eating, sleeping, shitting, fucking and
                                all of the other stupid biological quirks like feelings and emotions that machines
                                didn&rsquo;t have to worry about. However, the human technological progression marched
                                on due to the umbrella protection of culture. There were no cultures in the human world
                                that despised progress because progress brought with itself gifts, gifts of vast
                                magnitude. Things like poverty, sickness, desperation, famine etc. things that went
                                unsolved for thousands of years were easily solved by the advancement in agriculture,
                                production, distribution and political reforms providing everybody or atleast striving
                                to provide everybody equal opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Erdna Ednil was sure she could do something to make the whole scaling
                                thing work. She researched online and offline, engaged in several scientific social
                                gatherings, meeting several Nobel laureates, Turing award winners, Fields medalists etc.
                                and even tried to find the solution to the problem while dreaming. She finally met with
                                Yar Liewzruk, he was a technologist working at solving big issues humanity had faced but
                                hadn&rsquo;t taken any efforts to solve it. His company&rsquo;s name was Liewzruk
                                technologies. It worked on producing and developing advanced cellular size robotic
                                machines which could enter the human body and fix debilitating issues related to
                                hemoglobin damage, insulin reception, nerve degeneration. When she talked with him, he
                                told her how he hadn&rsquo;t finished even 1% of 1% of the problem. A robot capable of
                                harnessing energy using in situ resources like ATP, Oxygen to do work and at the same
                                time being able to repair and maintain itself was his dream. Erdna was fascinated to see
                                the advanced machines in his lab. The lab was equipped with millions of dollars worth of
                                equipment, over 400 different doctorate researchers all working on a single problem, the
                                problem of finding a way to build artificial living things. Living things were by
                                definition natural. When writing or speaking the word &lsquo;living thing,&rsquo; the
                                word &lsquo;natural&rsquo; was by default implied. Humans had no way of creating self
                                replicating robots capable of searching for energy, food in nature&rsquo;s case, and
                                able to survive in a hazardous world. Liewzruk was certain this problem was difficult
                                but not unsolvable. He had an advisory board in his company that was responsible for
                                planning the next steps for the company. The company invested heavily in nanotechnology,
                                brain imaging, computers, biolabs, protein research, DNA synthesis, organ printing, drug
                                manufacturing, cancer research and many other bleeding edge technologies. One thing the
                                company was certain of was the inevitability of the rapture termed
                                &lsquo;singularity&rsquo;. Liewzruk himself vigorously believed in it. The company
                                mapped &nbsp;its entire roadmap based on the timeline of the rapture&rsquo;s arrival.
                                Erdna was fascinated by this. She wanted to bring this zeitgeist to her own company. The
                                way to do this was by filling the book shelf in the lab with lots of books talking about
                                the arrival of the rapture. One such book was titled &lsquo;The Singularity is
                                Near&rsquo; by Ray Kurzweil. Liewzruk gave one of the copies he had to Erdna. The book
                                presented an optimistic timeline of the progress of technology presented through the
                                eyes of a visionary who was himself a genius.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;An assembler,&apos;&apos; shouted Erdna. &ldquo;A tabletop assembler would solve
                                all our problems.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; asked Jonas, one of the researchers. &ldquo;How would a replicator
                                solve all our problems?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;An assembler would make all the machines we need, in fact it would make the brain
                                itself given sufficient instructions.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Who would design the assembler then? It&apos;s a chicken and egg problem and only
                                nature ever found a solution to the chicken and egg problem through brute force
                                evolution.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We try. We try to make a single assembler that is general. A general table top
                                nano assembler. I think nanoscale dimension would be sufficient to produce details to
                                the atomic scale since atoms are not many nanometers in size.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Do you underestimate the engineering challenge behind it? Nobody has ever produced
                                a general assembler. Not even nature itself. It only ever produced specialized
                                assemblers or more specifically, &nbsp;assemblers capable of assembling carbon atoms. We
                                would need to work way, way, way hard to surpass that. How do you think of doing
                                that?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We start with biology itself.&rdquo; She answered with an excited expression.
                                &ldquo;We piggyback on the billions of years of evolution. We utilize the specialized
                                biological assemblers of nature to create the world&rsquo;s first general assembler
                                which is beyond DNA, beyond carbon, beyond proteins.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;How do we feed the instruction set to build parts for a general assembler? Using
                                DNA?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yes, we use CRISPR to pass gene instructions to the world&rsquo;s most abundant
                                nano assembly complex i.e bacteria and produce parts for specialized + 1 assembler. We
                                will not extract the parts. The parts will be reincorporated within the original
                                bacteria. And again using that improved bacterial assembler we create a specialized + 2
                                assembler. Till +500 the assembler will be almost indistinguishable from a bacteria but
                                then as it starts to increment from there and approaches +1000, we get increasingly
                                complex and general assembler until finally at +1000, we hit the final true general
                                assembler whose size would be billion times more than the staring bacteria because in a
                                way, we inflate the bacteria&rsquo;s size each time we add a 1.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Wow, using the big ole bacteria as the starting point for a general table top
                                assembler. Never thought those words would come out of my mouth. How did we arrive
                                here?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Evolution is powerful and with guided evolution, seems like nothing is out of
                                grasp.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, in a way, evolution in biology is just the continuation of the original
                                evolution, the evolution of the entire universe itself. Literally, we are just hydrogens
                                that evolved to think and feel. Photons and particles zooming at light speed
                                aren&rsquo;t capable of that. They don&rsquo;t incorporate time. Their biggest
                                limitation. Thank god for hydrogen. Photons evolved to be hydrogen in the early
                                universe, then that same hydrogen led to us.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c12">Chapter 12</a></h2>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin was wide awake. A tingling feeling he never felt before made
                                him shiver. The out shining rays of light from the sun breathe into his eyes.
                                &lsquo;Eyes also breathe.&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;We just word it to see.&rsquo; The
                                previous night, he was with Akitir. They were getting more and more close as the months
                                had passed by. This was distracting him from his work. He wanted to get back to his work
                                and continue to strive towards his goals. Lasin&rsquo;s new obsession was to try to
                                design a computer architecture that would directly lead to neuromorphic computing. This,
                                if successfully done, could accelerate the arrival of the rapture by several decades, he
                                thought. He had heard of the term &lsquo;singularity&rsquo; many times before. He
                                believed in it but never talked about it with his friends or colleagues. The word for a
                                person adhering to the beliefs of singularity was singularitarian. Some conservative
                                circles even used it as a derogative. Lasin thus, wasn&rsquo;t interested in singularity
                                at that time. He thought that if the singularity had to arrive, it would arrive, nobody
                                would be stopping it, but in case it didn&rsquo;t arrive, he and others must not bet
                                everything on it. Yes, the singularity would overturn the entire world within a night
                                and render all the hard work and progress of people after that meaningless but until
                                that people should try to solve challenging things themselves in order to improve
                                livelihood.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin after taking a mug of coffee from the kitchen snuck to his
                                cabin, then set his eyes on the bundles of pages of annual reports. His administrative
                                duty was made very easy by his great team. He never felt it was difficult to run the
                                company. After finding everything up to mark, he signed each and every paper and sent it
                                back to the financial officer. Lasin wanted to do all the things he wanted at the same
                                time. He wanted to manufacture all the things the world needed. He wanted to design all
                                the computers in the world. He also wanted to handle all the security whether it be
                                financial, internet, personnel etc. by his company. But then that was obviously
                                impossible other than by engaging a benevolent artificial super intelligence. Creating
                                such an artificial intelligence had been the company&rsquo;s AI department&rsquo;s goal
                                immediately after its formation. But even after more than 7 months, they seemed to have
                                accomplished nothing more than creating simple models for predicting statistical data
                                and representing that data in human readable forms like images, language, audio etc. AI
                                was more difficult than he thought, Lasin admitted. Creating a general AI was as
                                difficult as creating a general factory, Lasin thought. A car factory could never ever
                                produce jugs at the same rate, proportionally by size and mass, as cars. Even if it
                                could after complete transformation, it now couldn&rsquo;t produce cars without
                                retransforming the transformed factory into the original. This was the greatest
                                limitation to the economy. When cars were needed, car factories all came into use and
                                workers got paid and all was fine but then when car demands were satisfied and jugs
                                demand began to grow, the cars factories were now useless, neither producing cars nor
                                jugs since car demands were satisfied and jugs it couldn&rsquo;t produce. So a new jug
                                factory had to be constructed, which satisfied the jugs demand but then the cars demand
                                began to grow which caused the jugs factory to be useless. This inefficiency in
                                production due to the limitation of a factory as a manufacturing center for one specific
                                item made the economy unstable and keeping poverty out of bay difficult. &lsquo;What
                                could be done?&rsquo; Lasin thought. &lsquo;Maybe a general factory the size of an
                                average car factory capable of producing all the items in the world could usher in
                                abundance.&rsquo; Achieving abundance was Lasin&rsquo;s dream. He grew up in a poor
                                family so couldn&rsquo;t experience all the luxuries some of his colleagues got to
                                experience in their childhood. Although he didn&rsquo;t have that, he could make
                                billions of children from poor families around the world have the fun childhood they
                                deserved by achieving limitless abundance once and for all.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He researched online for several hours trying to find the one and
                                only company that would pop up in his view screen which he would acquire to have the
                                edge over others in terms of development of the best form of factory in the world. The
                                one factory that would be able to produce all the goods for the consumers and that he
                                would be able to manufacture cheaply. He didn&rsquo;t find any such company. Maybe there
                                wasn&rsquo;t one. The dream of his was mabe simply untrue. Maybe humanity would never
                                reach such a milestone in terms of innovation. Maybe humanity would always be the
                                culture run by slow meat creatures following nonsense rituals that had their origins in
                                primitive ancient history. Maybe the burden of meat sack would not allow humanity to do
                                anything more transformative than they had already done. That may be the case. That
                                wasn&rsquo;t what Lasin wanted but what could he do? He couldn&rsquo;t pray to some
                                deity like some 75% of humanity did and expect something to magically fall from the sky
                                carrying with it all the remedies to his problems. He needed to do it himself.
                                Lasin&rsquo;s long time and childhood dream was to live inside a video game. A virtual
                                reality that allowed for infinite exploration of whatever one wanted. How would one go
                                about creating such virtual reality? Lasin began to explore companies that were trying
                                to do exactly that, he didn&rsquo;t find anything as such but he did find a company
                                trying to build brain-machine interfaces that would allow for the human brain to connect
                                with a computer via tiny thread like wires which would then allow for two way
                                communication between them. If that was accomplished then the brain would be able to
                                signal to the computer sending messages and the computer inturn would be able to signal
                                back emotions, states, senses etc. which would make the human brain think it was inside
                                some other reality, the reality that was created by the computer that it was unknowingly
                                attached to via channels. Lasin wanted to talk with the company. The company&rsquo;s
                                name was Neuralink. It was founded by Elon Musk. He checked all the reports the company
                                had published, including financial reports and went on to find out that the company
                                until now hadn&rsquo;t made any progress inserting the device in the actual human brain.
                                The trials conducted in mice and monkeys were successful to some extent but they later
                                tended to contract some disease that led to their untimely death. This was found in 8
                                out of 10 animals. Such high risk of death rate for a clinical trial to be conducted in
                                human volunteers was unacceptable. Maybe it would take another 50 years for the company
                                to be successful in its ultimate goal? What was the ultimate goal of the company? It was
                                namely the merging of humans with machines or merging of the human brain with artificial
                                intelligence by adding a layer of artificial brain power on top of the natural outer
                                layer. This was a lofty goal for a startup. Lasin went to visit the company the next
                                day. He met with the company&rsquo;s CEO, Anya Chana, she was an Indian Phd specializing
                                in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The company didn&rsquo;t need any financial
                                officers at that stage for there was none. It didn&rsquo;t have a board, an
                                administrative department or anything. The company was pure research group and they were
                                researching furiously. But since the problem was so hard, it was impossible to solve it
                                in one go. The brain and computer were two completely different things and connecting
                                them through an interface was completely sci-fi until just 20 years ago. Still though,
                                the interface was messy, although the brain used electricity and nerve channels like
                                circuits inside an artificial chip, the delay in speed was causing problems regarding
                                the running of real time batch sequencing algorithms used for sensors. The sensors used
                                in houses and cars like camera, heat sensor, sound microphone worked on very different
                                principles and didn&rsquo;t have to worry about energy insufficiency so they were
                                designed with optimization in mind. But evolution didn&rsquo;t get that privilege, it
                                had to produce a working product after a slight design alteration through a mutation or
                                that animal carrying the product went extinct. Completely and utterly different method
                                of creating the same sensor. One in CAD and other in genes and marshes. Maybe that
                                didn&rsquo;t matter, maybe the two would some day merge effectively through some
                                ingenious solution that humans weren&rsquo;t able to figure out. Lasin wanted that to be
                                true. But he couldn&rsquo;t have pipe dreams about such things. He needed to base
                                himself in reality. The CEO talked,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Look sir, we have all the major hardware required to do the research but we seem
                                to have been stuck in this limbo of neither here nor there without the human
                                trial.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;But without fixing what&apos;s causing those deaths, don&rsquo;t you think
                                it&rsquo;ll be a bit risky to test it out on human volunteers?&rdquo; Lasin replied
                                back.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The problem was the pseudo organic reaction taking place between the immune cells
                                in the brain and our tiny threads. It led to the death of nearby cells and caused
                                stroke-like symptoms in the subject. We couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to fix this major
                                issue but by a slight favor of luck, we managed to halt the progression of cell deaths
                                by injecting immuno-suppression drugs in the brain. The immuno-suppression drugs in the
                                brain couldn&rsquo;t travel outside the brain due to the BBB which prevented unwanted
                                side effects in other parts of the body. But that didn&rsquo;t work out in the long
                                term. Although it prevented those cell deaths and got rid of the strokes, other
                                infectious diseases that targeted the brain were now given a leeway since there was now
                                virtually no immunity inside the brain. Diseases could now target the brain like it was
                                the easiest lunch in the entire body. The diseases that didn&rsquo;t target the brain
                                began to target the brain, now you get the feel of how serious the trouble was becoming.
                                We at last coated the outer layer of the micro threads with an oxidation and reduction
                                preventing aluminum coat and the problem got figured out itself. Science is unexpected.
                                Who knew CAD was the solution instead of drug injections?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that machine over there?&rdquo; Lasin pointed to a bulky machine that
                                looked like a radiation therapy gun.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It is exactly what you think sir.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What? You are having cancer problems?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You are correct. We regret to admit it but 4 out of 10 monkeys almost always get
                                some form of brain cancer. The cancer cells cluster around the electrode threads which
                                is why they cannot be surgically removed like in case of tumor. The only treatment that
                                worked until now is radiation therapy.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You are actually having more problems than I thought. How are you thinking of
                                overcoming all these hurdles for beginning your human trials next year?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We are on track. We aim to solve the cancer problem by reducing the current
                                voltage in the threads and inserting them in the brain using utmost precision with the
                                Caliver surgical robot.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the longest time any of your monkeys survived?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;3 years after undergoing their implant, we have 3 monkeys still alive and
                                well.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t enough. You must have at least 50% of the monkeys alive and
                                well. 3 out of 10 isn&rsquo;t a good score.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, but we are the first one that&rsquo;s tackling the problem in over two
                                decades. So we definitely need some leeway.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I hope you succeed. What was your company&rsquo;s charter again? If you
                                can&rsquo;t beat them, join them? That&rsquo;s so sci-fi sounding.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Well, if you show today&rsquo;s technology to anybody living in the early 18th
                                century, then they would think the same. But when progress flows sequentially, nobody is
                                surprised at the end.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The acceleration of technology that many are talking about, what do you think
                                about it?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s going to happen but I try not to focus too much of my
                                attention on it. We try to do stuff, not wait for some rapture of exponentially
                                exploding technology in some distant future.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not distant, they say. They say it may happen as soon as 2045, do you
                                believe in this data?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Probably more like 2077 or 2083.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With this, they ended their talk. Lasin was happy with the web
                                conference. He wanted to open a brain implant technology in Nepal himself. But the
                                resources needed for it like top Phds, labs, advanced equipment and robots were not
                                readily available. The next best thing he could think of was to buy out the Neuralink
                                company but that seemed radical in that early stage. The technology they were developing
                                wasn&rsquo;t even working properly. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a good investment of the
                                company cash reserve. He had no problem with trying to start from scratch but he was
                                feeling tired with all the projects he had in hand and wasn&rsquo;t feeling up to adding
                                another one on top of it.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later on when Lasin was on the phone with the energy minister of
                                Nepal, he was hit with another much bigger problem that actually had to be solved
                                instead of fantasizing about putting chips inside people&rsquo;s heads. The problem was
                                that the energy consumption in Nepal had increased in the last 4 years drastically
                                mainly due to the rapid establishment of several seed companies that leveraged from the
                                China-Nepal technology transfer initiated by Ytiralugnis and the massive funding of
                                foreign venture capitalists trying to capitalize on it. The energy supply wasn&rsquo;t
                                sufficient, so the department of energy requested Lasin to do something about it. Nepal
                                for its majority of electricity depended upon its hydro power infrastructure. The rivers
                                in Nepal displaced several millions of tons of water every second. That momentum was
                                then used to rotate large turbines which then converted the mechanical energy into
                                electricity which was then transmitted to the whole nation through the grid. The power
                                cables in Nepal hadn&apos;t gone underground. Majority of cities in Nepal had this
                                problem. Kathmandu was an exception. The naked wires caused bird deaths, injuries to
                                citizens and fires in houses. The capital to take aloof those wires underground simply
                                didn&rsquo;t exist before. Underground transmission lines also prevented energy loss
                                while transmitting. The incentive existed for the government to take the initiative so
                                now it was trying to do exactly that. Lasin put the phone down. He was ready to do
                                something about this energy shortage. But first he needed to take a shower. Spending all
                                day in the construction field where a new garage bay was constructed to house the
                                machinery the company was producing made him dirty and stinky. He almost spent 1 hour in
                                the shower. After putting on new clothes from the locker in his cabin, he was ready to
                                get to his office. He opened his laptop and looked up some energy solution companies
                                online. He found many energy production alternatives to conventional sources. The most
                                talked about on the internet was unsurprisingly fusion energy. Fusion was a lingering
                                problem that big nations had failed to figure out. It was notoriously difficult to
                                produce plasma inside a container. Even if the plasma was produced it lasted for a short
                                time and even after that it required more input energy than it was capable of
                                outputting. The solution to this infuriating problem had eluded scientists for more than
                                30 years. Something had to finally be done for getting fusion to the market. Lasin
                                couldn&rsquo;t figure out how he could take part in figuring out fusion. Many graduates
                                found fusion research to be an illustrative career since much of fusion research was
                                funded by governments&apos; deep pockets.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin figured out if he wanted to get a ride on the fusion train, he
                                would need to develop an innovative solution to the plasma creation and sustenance
                                problem. By patenting the solution to the problem, he could earn money by licensing it
                                to big foreign governments. He could also charge less fees for small countries so that
                                they would also get a chance to get on the bandwagon. All in all, it was a nice thought.
                                But how would he go about figuring out the plasma problem? He could hire graduate
                                researchers from top Nepalese universities to get them to work on it immediately but he
                                concluded that it wouldn&rsquo;t produce tangible results since no university in Nepal
                                had fusion energy programs for students. The next thing he could do was contact the
                                Indian government and agree to send some of their top IIT graduates on a foreign
                                research program in Nepal. That would benefit both nations since under the deal those
                                graduates could come back to India to implement fusion without having to license it from
                                the company thereby saving billions of rupees. Prototype fusion could turn out to be
                                expensive to build from scratch so Lasin could take as much help as possible from both
                                the governments. India and Nepal relationship was fleeting due to increasing Nepal-China
                                alliance. Both of them collaborating to develop fusion could lead them to have better
                                relationships than ever before. Lasin had to do it, it would mean a better economy,
                                better bilateral trade and a better green energy future. He decided to focus the next
                                few years of his life on this single problem, to bring fusion from the pages to the real
                                world.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin called Niban to his office, they sat down to talk about
                                Lasin&rsquo;s fusion dream. Lasin wrote something in a notebook, he outlined a basic
                                comparative magnetic fusion chamber composed of titanium vanadium alloy that allowed for
                                maximum heat sustenance.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t this problem already solved?&rdquo; Niban asked with a confused face.
                            </p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a really difficult and notorious problem. Don&rsquo;t
                                think it&rsquo;ll be solved anytime soon.&rdquo; Lasin answered back with a serious
                                tone.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The national defence budget isn&rsquo;t utilized right now to build bombs, maybe
                                we can use some of that money to establish a fusion center in this district. I mean
                                Bharatpur already has some electricity production infrastructure. We would need to just
                                add a fusion cell on top of it to make our prototype.&rdquo; Niban said to Lasin.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Creating a plasma encapsulating chamber is looking difficult, forget a cell
                                capable of outputting energy at this stage. Even if we accomplish making a cell, we
                                would need to solve the energy hurdle. Fusion always takes more energy in the labs than
                                it is capable of producing. That could take the maximum time to solve since it is the
                                only problem that is yet to be solved. Many countries have built cells that can sustain
                                plasma for hours but none have yet produced surplus energy using it. The superconducting
                                magnets consume an extremely high amount of electricity.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;How do they hold the temperature of those superconducting magnets? It must get
                                extremely hot inside the cell.&rdquo; Niban asked, looking surprised.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Well, the magnets are heavily insulated and are liquid cooled. That liquid cooling
                                mechanism is the most electricity consuming part of the cell. If that is solved, surplus
                                energy can certainly be produced from the cell.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Let&apos;s do it then. Let&rsquo;s fix those magnets.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It is difficult. Ordinary magnets don&rsquo;t generate strong enough magnetic
                                fields to suspend the plasma in the middle of the donut shaped chamber. Even CERN uses
                                superconducting magnets for its ring particle accelerator.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;But particle accelerators like CERN have to accelerate particles to almost the
                                speed of light. We don&rsquo;t have to do that. Right?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Well actually we have to. We have to heat the fusion material to temperatures so
                                high that their atoms collide with each other at almost the speed of light. This extreme
                                speed and energy is what fuses those nucleuses together.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;God damn. It&rsquo;s so much more complicated than I thought!&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason why fusion is always 30 years away and not 3 years
                                away.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After their discussion, Lasin decided to hold a company meeting and
                                try to figure out the employees&rsquo; perspective on the problem. The company consisted
                                of the best talents in Nepal. Nepalese university design was based on a top down
                                architecture. If the administration decided that any student deserved a merit for a
                                fellowship at a research center, then the student would get a monthly allowance for
                                rent, food and asylum. The research money wasn&rsquo;t included in it but if the student
                                had a proposal then the local government could add it to the money in the university
                                allowance. This didn&rsquo;t get graduates motivated to work on experimental science or
                                theoretical departments. They much preferred to work on already established centers like
                                medical labs, chemical industries, agriculture plants and zoological centers. This
                                fulfilled their underfunded post graduate life. This type of risk averse academic design
                                wouldn&rsquo;t work for an innovation based economy, Lasin thought. He tried to think of
                                a better university structure that would allow for students that were willing to take
                                risks and find better solutions to several problems in the science and technology
                                sector. But whatever he thought of, the results could be reaped only after more than 10
                                years since fusion energy programs from undergrad to grad level would take a generation
                                of students at high school 7 years to complete and 3 years of Phd. Lasin was in a hurry,
                                he wanted to do something right then. The meeting ended with many agreeing that anybody
                                in academics wasn&rsquo;t going to bring them closer to their big goal. They need to
                                open a fusion branch abroad to take advantage of their scholarly advantage. Was the
                                problem completely out of reach in Nepal, Lasin thought to himself. Maybe the India
                                collaboration problem might work, he considered. All in all, Lasin was prepared to do
                                anything to achieve fusion. The next several months nothing major happened although all
                                the bureaucratic hurdles for transferring IIT graduates from India to Nepal had been
                                crossed. The only thing that was left was a research center dedicated to fusion energy
                                to be established in Nepal. It would require massive amounts of investment which the
                                company could afford.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The center was finished constructing. The work consisted of building
                                a wide bay whose roof was constructed of tin to cut costs. The inside was white. White
                                inside was an insistence of Lasin. He thought that a building consisting of a white
                                interior and white flooring gave it a sci-fi vibe that made everybody working inside a
                                motivation to work on bringing that possible future closer. But the sci-fi aspect
                                wasn&rsquo;t the only reason for a completely white interior space. The white interior
                                also allowed for maximum light to reflect off surfaces. This made everything more
                                illuminated and easy to see, overall preventing injuries due to accidental collisions
                                with machineries. The space measured about 4000 square meters. Big enough to house one
                                or two JETs. JET, which stands for Joint European Torus, was the original donut shaped
                                fusion reactor. It was shaped like a donut that was surrounded by powerful magnets. Its
                                plasma containment chamber was the size of a small house. Overall, this massive reactor
                                could produce and contain heated plasma for more than 6 hours. But unfortunately, it
                                consumed more energy to keep that plasma contained than the plasma radiated heat which
                                was then converted to electricity using a steam turbine. Steam turbines were inefficient
                                but they worked which couldn&rsquo;t be said for other ways of converting heat energy
                                into electricity. JET in the end turned out to be a failure. The superconducting magnets
                                it seemed were certainly not the way to go. Sadly, a new method was never found.
                                That&rsquo;s where fusion research was stuck at. Ytiralugnis, a company dedicated to
                                advancing the human frontier could certainly work on finding a panacea that would solve
                                all problems of fusion once and for all but it could also turn out to be a complete
                                failure in the end. Nothing was guaranteed in this field.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sci-fi, continually surprising and getting ever more creative, this
                                form of literature was the dominant genre of writing in the early 21st century. It
                                expanded the minds of many creative writers who dreamed up crazy sounding and far
                                reaching ideas about humanity, culture, space, technology and the entire universe. No
                                other form of literature was as expansive in terms of scope as sci-fi. Sci-fi was
                                literally the king of literature. The main reason for this could be attributed to the
                                grounding of sci-fi mostly in the physical reality but with implications beyond the day
                                to day chores of primitive humans. It ramped up the scope of human civilization&rsquo;s
                                scientific accomplishments several fold which allowed for unimaginable possibilities
                                impossible using contemporary science. This prospect excited the reader and made him/her
                                able to inhabit that world through the writing itself. Exploration sci-fi genres were
                                the most popular since they adhered to the inner desire of all human beings to explore
                                unexplored territories and charter uncharted areas. Romance or crime novels
                                couldn&rsquo;t do that. In fact, sci-fi writings sometimes predicted the arrival of
                                technologies they described in the real world. This was why scientists often tried to
                                work on bringing sci-fi technologies to reality. They found them plausible and saw them
                                not breaking any physical rules which was necessary for something to exist in the
                                physical world. The most sought after sci-fi technologies that everybody was fond of was
                                instantaneous teleportation, force shield, invisibility cloak, laser weapons, time
                                travel, black hole energy, fusion energy, interstellar ships, Dyson spheres, solar
                                system colonies, habitable exoplanets, galactic civilizations, intergalactic travel,
                                multiverse, parallel universes, infinite energy, aliens, advance artificial
                                intelligence, benevolent superintelligence, utopian culture, material abundance,
                                money-less society etc. These technologies were thoroughly explored in several writings.
                                Famous books on some of these topics were reprinted and sold millions of times. Of the
                                forms most extreme, the stories featuring galactic civilizations where a single species
                                was able to conquer the entire galaxy was the most engaging. It was assumed since the
                                ancient history that humans were the only species in the universe. Maybe it was because
                                the anicent people didn&rsquo;t know the actual size of the universe but nonetheless,
                                they couldn&rsquo;t fathom that another species was somewhere out there in the sky.
                                Later on, as science progressed and the place of humans among the universe was
                                identified, people began to beg the question, &ldquo;I there life out there?&rdquo; Many
                                believed no from their own experiences but may more also believed that there were
                                infinitely many civilizations out there in the universe because they believed the
                                universe to be infinte in size as well as scope. They believed that there were other
                                universes with laws different from theirs and so those universes could turn out to be
                                more exotic than the one they were inhabiting. These contadicting views weren&rsquo;t
                                well recieved by the general public, they wanted the real truth. But it was impossible
                                for humans to find out the real truth without mapping the entire universe which they
                                couldn&rsquo;t do. For them to prove that they were not alone, they would only need to
                                spot one alien in the midst of space but to absolutely prove that they were 100% alone
                                in the entire universe, they would need to charter the entire universe. This roadblock
                                led to many theorizing that if there was intelligent life anywhere else in the universe,
                                they would be much more technologically advanced than them which would mean that they
                                would have conquered most of the space. So, to prove that aliens existed, the only thing
                                humans need to do was to look for their signs. People surmised that advanced alien
                                species would be putting trillions of trillions of intelligent signals which would be
                                hard to ignore. But even after carefully looking at their sky, they spotted no
                                intelligent signals. Some believed that the aliens were deliberately hiding their traces
                                so as to not be spotted by humans. But why would they do that? The other people
                                questioned. If aliens were consciously hiding from humans, what was the reason behind
                                it? Maybe they were planning to conquer Earth and enslave humanity. Such quandaries
                                always remained in the human psyche continuously haunting them which they then converted
                                into movies and drama shows like Star Trek, Star Wars, Alien etc. It would be very
                                difficult for aliens to hide their traces since any civilization would be constantly
                                producing waste materials as much as they tried not to. This was a bottleneck in every
                                kind of energy consuming system. Coal after burning produced ashes, fossil fuel after
                                burning produced carbon dioxide, computation produced heat, fusion in the stars produced
                                heat, any kind of physical system using energy produced unwanted waste whose purest form
                                was waste heat. This waste heat was responsible for the inefficiency of every physical
                                system. No physical system consuming energy was capable of converting 100% of it into
                                working energy. This inherent limitation of a physical system was responsible for the
                                slow degradation of the quality of the entire universe. Early on, the universe contained
                                much more useful energy which was slowly consumed by the stars which transformed it into
                                light and heat energy and distributed to the surroundings. Some of this heat radiation
                                striked a planet which allowed for several geological changes to occur that shaped the
                                entire planet. Through millions of years of slow changes, the planet&rsquo;s face
                                changed and harbored intelligent life that evolved from the waste heat of the stars, the
                                waste that stars couldn&rsquo;t resist throwing away while fusing their elements using
                                the gravitational force. Some tried to imagine what a civilization spanning the entire
                                galaxy would have. Knowledge and culture grew with the size of the population. The
                                knowledge and culture of a small country was small compared to a large country where
                                millions more inhabited. The increase in the size of the total knowledge of a populous
                                constituted the power and influence of that society. When one country conquered another
                                country, they gained the knowledge and culture of the new society. The new
                                society&rsquo;s values, traditions, ideas were now able to disseminate to the new
                                arrivals. This increase in the size of the knowledge of the conquering country thereby
                                increased its scope and power. So, continuing this logic, one could see the implications
                                of a galaxy spanning society. Their knowledge base would be incomprehensible because
                                their population would be immense. Each of the individuals in the galaxy wide
                                civilization would adhere to some values which they respected. The values that guided
                                that individual would also guide others and so this produced a unique culture among the
                                similar individuals. Over the thousands of years of the civilization&rsquo;s timeline,
                                the culture would disseminate to other parts of the galaxy at the speed of light when it
                                would finally encounter the most distant culture in the entire galaxy. Where one culture
                                found the solution to the most ligering problem of the entire galaxy, it could send
                                probes thereby transferring the most valuable information for the whole galaxy at the
                                speed of light itself like a biblical god sending rays of salvation. This process would
                                lead to the most extreme form of abundance one could imagine. Each individual would have
                                the choice of watching another individual&rsquo;s creation from the other side of the
                                galaxy and everybody else thereby having abundant sources of entertainment and knowledge
                                of all kinds. The whole galaxy would transform into a utopian frenzy consisting of any
                                kind of imaginable thing possible for free. The Economy would be moneyless, material
                                requirements would be limited only by the speed of light itself, if information to
                                create something existed then that something could be materialized in an instant by
                                advanced synthesis methods for free. This continuous production and adoption of new
                                values created a galactic civilization consisting of extremely diverse species,
                                thousands of trillions of inhabitants, the most unique and powerful cultures and the
                                biggest knowledge base of ideas, information and history in the entire universe. This
                                power was thirsted upon by the writers of science fiction when they dreamed of such
                                civilizations. Just imagine what it could do to a human mind that was centered on the
                                dreadful contemporary challenges Earth, mass starvation, societal collapse, terrorism,
                                religious zealotry, war, pandemic, desperation, human condition, mass psychosis, mass
                                hysteria etc. He/She would feel terrible and might lose hope on humanity itself due to
                                its stupidness and inability to see the bigger picture. Lust, greed and power corrupted
                                Earth&rsquo;s inhabitants to unleash untolds amount of destruction upon the people
                                thereby turning the dream of a blissful future with vast meadows of infinite pleasure,
                                abundance and happiness into the present hellish landscape of torture, pain and
                                suffering.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akitir was in her cabin when suddenly the phone rang up.
                                &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she asked after picking up the phone.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Hello mam, we are the european nucleus research center speaking. We would like you
                                to confirm the order of 3 torus subsections for the plasma chamber containment
                                vessel.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&lsquo;Woah, they are building the reactor already?&rsquo; Akitir thought to herself.
                                &ldquo;Yeah, sure, let me confirm.&rdquo; She looked at the order logs in the company
                                financial profile. There under the section of fusion reactor 1, Date: 7/11, she saw the
                                orders for a titanium-vanadium torus. The ring was listed as unarrived. She looked at
                                the company&rsquo;s name and reached back on her phone.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, I would like to confirm the orders.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sure, mam. We would like to add that the torus sections are yet to be constructed
                                so will take a month or so for that to finish and an additional 2 or 3 weeks for the
                                delivery.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Ok, thankyou for calling.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akitir was kinda surprised to get the call. She expected the reactor
                                construction to begin fro, late October or early November but this was mid July. The
                                people at the top were really hurried about this project she thought. She called Lasin
                                to inform about the call but he didn&rsquo;t receive it so she went to the main room.
                                There she found Aniba and Niban but not Lasin.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Where is Lasin?&rdquo; she asked Aniba.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know man. I think he is not in the city.&rdquo; Aniba replied.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You must know where he is right? You are the early fusion project handler and
                                primary assistant of Lasin. How can you say you don&rsquo;t know? You are being careless
                                I see.&rdquo; Akitir said to Aniba with an angry voice.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Aniba hearing those words got hurt. She didn&rsquo;t expect Akitir to be so rude. Her
                                voice got stuck at her throat. Then after gulping a painful breath she spoke.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry mam. I apologize for my carelessness. I will be better next
                                time.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it that bad for you to apologize. Maybe I was a bit rude. I am
                                just tired today.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Akitir,&rdquo; Niban said turning to Akitir, &ldquo;I found from the notice from
                                his leave email that he is at his brother&rsquo;s house today because his nephew got
                                sick. He said everything is fine and he would certainly return back tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a relief. Thank You Niban. And Aniba, I hope you don&rsquo;t
                                mind.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Of Course mam, why would I?&rdquo; Aniba replied.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;By the way, the torus sections the fusion department ordered, they are arriving
                                next month.&rdquo; Akitir said looking at them side by side. &ldquo;So we have to make
                                room for them. It&rsquo;s already been 6 months since construction of the factory bay
                                started and we still haven&rsquo;t cleaned the reactor room for housing the machine.
                                Aniba, get it done by today. And check all the appliances you need, I will supply them.
                                Finally getting some new job as a supply chain manager. It was so boring the past
                                year.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yes mam, I will do so. Also mam, I am getting notice that the workers are feeling
                                hot working at the machining bay. Maybe we can install better temperature management
                                there.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Ok, I will send two RyzedX room temperature conditioner there right now.&rdquo;
                                Akitir said to Aniba.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with the workers at the factory today? They are acting a bit
                                weird.&rdquo; Niban said, looking at Aniba.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Maybe it&apos;s boredom or insufficient pay or something. We really can&rsquo;t
                                say. Somebody will have to take the job of motivating them to work hard and fast. We
                                really aren&rsquo;t done with the ceiling wiring yet. The water supply to the reactor
                                room is required to be 500 liters per sec, we are only getting around 12. The
                                electricity requirement is more than 234 mega watts. Even at the proximity of the
                                Narayani hydroelectricity plant, we are getting around 23 mega&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Watts. We have to solve these mammoth issues before the torus testing begins maybe around
                                early december or sooner.&rdquo; Aniba replied.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;500 liters of water to the fusion room? And I guess the water must be distilled?
                                We haven&rsquo;t built that distillation plant yet. That&rsquo;s going to consume a lot
                                of electricity and we are in shortage right now. Holy, this project is so
                                unforgiving.&rdquo; Niban said, looking at Aniba.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, the distillation plant construction will begin early next month. We must be
                                looking at a construction time of 2 to 3 months. Well before the first test around
                                December.&rdquo; Aniba said.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Why are the workers getting angry? Maybe the food is bad? What&rsquo;s up with the
                                mess? Is the food there good? I think I might need to talk to the mess manager.&rdquo;
                                Niba said, sounding concerned and agitated.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, good food is vital for optimal work performance. Might need to change the
                                mess menu. 40% of the workers live here 5 days a week so we definitely need to make the
                                dinner and breakfast better. Will ask the financial officer to supply more money to the
                                mess today.&rdquo; Aniba said, sounding concerned.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do it right now?&rdquo; Akitir spoke.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Right now? Should I call him here?&rdquo; Aniba said surprised.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah.. call him.&rdquo; Akitir said bluntly.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After being called by Aniba, the mess manager Oshok came to the main
                                office. He looked at Aniba and spoke,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yes mam. You called me.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yes, I wanted to talk to you about the mess food. I don&rsquo;t think it&apos;s
                                satisfactory to the workers. Some of them have complained about it. Do you want to add
                                anything?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Mam, the food is fine. The kitchen is operating at max capacity. We are doing the
                                best. Everybody is eating full.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What??&rdquo; Aniba said in an angry tone. &ldquo;The kitchen is operating at max
                                capacity? Well, how can that be???&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;The kitchen is the biggest
                                in all of Nepal. We have supplied the best cooktops and all the kitchen utensils. How
                                can the kitchen be strained?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sorry mam, didn&rsquo;t mean to say that. I meant that the workers aren&rsquo;t
                                sufficient. I had to lay off 4 workers from the 30. We didn&rsquo;t have enough money to
                                pay all of them.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What?? Are you joking?&rdquo; Aniba shouted, exposing her teeths. The manger was
                                shaken and taken back a little. Aniba approached him and leaned near to his face. She
                                was taller than him. &ldquo;The money that&rsquo;s being paid to the workers is looked
                                after by myself. I wrote the checks and submitted them to the finance office. How can
                                there be insufficient pay? What are you talking about? I need answers.&rdquo; She
                                stopped talking and stared at Oshok with her bulging eyes.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to shout Aniba. Let him explain first.&rdquo; Akitir said to
                                Aniba and then immediately turned to Oshok. &rdquo;What happened? Tell me exact details.
                                Why did you lay off 2 employees without asking us? Who gave you the permission? You are
                                responsible for taking care of the kitchen and food orderings, not for laying off
                                workers. And most importantly what did you do with the money of those 4 workers. Last
                                time I checked the kitchen employees&rsquo; pay records, they didn&rsquo;t show me a
                                salary increase. &rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Niban was called by one of the workers so he left the gathering.
                                Akitir, Aniba and Oshok were now standing alone in the center of the office.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry mam.&rdquo; Oshok spoke, then he began to cry. &ldquo;I
                                didn&rsquo;t pay the workers. I took the money away for myself. I&rsquo;m extremely
                                sorry. I beg your mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Akitir was absolutely furious with Oshok. He had committed a scandalous act of laying off
                                workers and possibly cutting off worker&rsquo;s pay to benefit himself. The reputation
                                the company had gathered over the past 6 years as Nepal&rsquo;s leading hope and beacon
                                of economic prosperity for workers who were paid fairly and on time was damaged by one
                                rat who saw an opportunity for himself by becoming corrupt. Aktiir was furious. The
                                workers who were laid off were faithful and loved the working place in the sense that
                                they didn&rsquo;t announce them being kicked off to the public, Akitir thought. She
                                wasn&rsquo;t able to hold her rage. She repeatedly shouted, &ldquo;Why did you do
                                this??&rdquo; and slapped him in his face multiple times. Aniba couldn&rsquo;t stop her.
                                The nearby employees came there after hearing the shouting and restrained Akitir,
                                stopping her from hitting him further. Oshok&apos;s face was red. He had blood dripping
                                from a wound in his left cheek bone which was caused by Akitir&rsquo;s phone she holded
                                in her right hand. The phone contained diamond style crystals casing which were sharp
                                and caused injury on his face. Oshok was groaning with pain. Niban and other employees
                                carried him to the medical room where he stayed.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was early morning the next day. Lasin had arrived from his
                                brother&rsquo;s house early. He heard about the recent incident that had occurred at the
                                company. Rather than taking the perspective of random observers, he wanted to talk to
                                his love directly to get her first hand account about the incident. Akitir loved the
                                company. She was the first employee directly hired by Lasin himself to look after the
                                essential duties of a supply chain manager as the company was experiencing a major surge
                                in growth. If there was anybody else in her place when the incident took place, they
                                might have reacted differently. They might not even have been phased. But, she
                                wasn&rsquo;t some random employee coming to the company for growing their CV. The
                                company was like a part of her heart. For her, it was more than just an enterprise.
                                Lasin came by her at her cabin. The company office had turned into a big apartment
                                complex. It was a big house where all of the top executive employees had one floor to
                                them. Lasin had visited Akitir&rsquo;s lodge multiple times. She decorated her rooms in
                                a stylish and futuristic manner. Lasin absolutely loved it. He even said to Akitir one
                                day that she had deliberately designed her quarter that way to appeal to Lasin, to lure
                                him in there. She smiled at his face and told it wasn&rsquo;t the case. She had loved
                                futuristic architecture since her childhood, she said. So, it was imperative for her to
                                design her stay quarters where she spent most of the year in that style. Akitir was
                                sitting at a desk. Lasin approached her, pulled a chair and after placing it beside her,
                                sat in it. He looked into her eyes, smiled a perfect smile and spoke,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What did you do yesterday? I heard you hit the mess manager in the face. His
                                injury was so severe that he had to be taken to the medical room.&rdquo; He smiled.
                                &ldquo;You still angry? Don&rsquo;t want to talk? If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s
                                fine. I won&rsquo;t bother. I don&rsquo;t care about him. I already know what he did.
                                That piece of shit deserved no better. Even if he was completely hospitalized by your
                                beating, I couldn&rsquo;t care less. But I&apos;m concerned about you. You have been
                                silent since that evening. Do you regret it or what? If I was you then I wouldn&rsquo;t.
                                I ..&rdquo; He was suddenly stopped by Akitir raising her left hand.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Can you please leave me alone for some moment. I don&rsquo;t feel like talking
                                today. I will return to the office tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Oh honey, why do you worry about taking leaves? If you want 10 days leave, I will
                                give you 15. But please talk to me, okay? I can&rsquo;t see you like this. Alone and
                                sad. I love you more than myself.&rdquo; Lasin stood up, took her left hand that laid at
                                his right and kissed it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in the evening, okay? Prepare a good
                                dinner for me.&rdquo; With that, he approached the door and turned his head back to see
                                if she was still there, which wasn&rsquo;t really necessary since humans didn&rsquo;t
                                vanish suddenly. After that he left.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day went smoothly. Some concerns were raised by the board members
                                about the previous day&rsquo;s incident but it was taken care of by the company&rsquo;s
                                PR managers. Oshok was immediately suspended and wasn&rsquo;t apprehended for PR
                                reasons. The company&rsquo;s policies however were changed and drastic measures were put
                                forward to quell any future corruption issues. The company held a meeting that afternoon
                                and discussed employee management and fair conduct by managers and administrators. From
                                then on, no manager was given the right to fire employees without consulting with the
                                board first. It was a big decision since the company had grown to be so big but it was
                                necessary to let everybody know how serious the situation had come to become. Nothing
                                interesting happened afterwards with Lasin other than Akitir&rsquo;s foreign friends
                                Rabbie and Emma asking about her. Everybody knew about what was going on between Akitir
                                and Lasin, it was no surprise but it surprised Lasin to see her friends talking to him
                                so frankly. Lasin was the company&rsquo;s original founder along with Niban. So it was a
                                new experience when anybody other than Akitir talked frankly with him. Niban called
                                Lasin and informed him that there was a municipality inspection committee coming to
                                investigate the distillation center land. Lasin hurried upstairs where the
                                company&rsquo;s important files, data and server information was kept safely. He met
                                with the file manager, Rahpratap and asked him to find the land certifications and DPR
                                of the distillation site. After about 15 minutes of body sweating searching, Rahpratap
                                presented the bundle of files to Lasin. Lasin thanked him for finding them so quickly
                                since it was always difficult to keep track of a few documents of a house let alone an
                                entire company. Niban and Lasin preferred to do the high level government tasks
                                themselves instead of assigning them to somebody below their command. The inspection
                                went on smoothly. It took about 4 hours, longer than required like any other government
                                involved work. Finally at 7 o&rsquo;clock they both arrived at the office carrying with
                                them the license certification to start building the distiller plant. Lasin wasn&rsquo;
                                done with some of the work he had laying on the desk in the morning. He focused his
                                attention onto those. It took him an hour to complete those.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the work was over, Lasin suddenly realized that he had made a
                                promise that morning with Akitir to come to her quarters for dinner. But so much had
                                happened in the intervening afternoon regarding policies and changes. He was very tired
                                and wanted to go straight to his bed and sleep for the whole 9 hours. So, was he going
                                to her? He had his answer ready immediately. If there was one thing in life that he was
                                more certain of death, it was that he would never tell false promises to Akitir. Maybe
                                Akitir had prepared dinner or maybe she had not, it didn&rsquo;t matter. What mattered
                                was that he was going to spend that night with her. It was 9 o&rsquo;clock. For a late
                                dinner together with Akitir, the timing was not bad. The circumstances though were. He
                                was drunk and needed to empty his mind before driving to Akitir&rsquo;s quarters. It was
                                2 km away. He hopped inside his car, tightened his seat belts and drove straight to the
                                housing complex. Akitir&rsquo;s room was on the fourth floor. He came out of the
                                elevator and knocked on the door. After a few knocks, the door opened from the inside.
                                The room was lit to create a red atmosphere. Lasin entered the room and found himself in
                                a fragrant room that smelled of love. He knew what was happening. Akitir had prepared
                                something special. She may have done so to forget the previous day&rsquo;s incident or
                                to simply please Lasin. Either could be true. Anyways, she had prepared a special dinner
                                that night to quell Lasin&rsquo;s appetite. The culinary delicacy consisted of Indian
                                masala puree, Paneer mixed with special Punjabi curry, puree Dudhi chana, Lakcho Mag,
                                Rajma with special curry, French fries, chicken curry for protein and rice for carbs.
                                Lasin had not expected such delightful cuisine. He loved every dish which was hand made
                                by Akitir and some staff, undoubtedly. Nobody could prepare so much food in such a short
                                amount of time. After having dinner, the both chatted a little. Lasin spoke first,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the worry? You seem to be sad still. If I may cheer you up with
                                some good news then I would like to say that the dork you hit yesterday is fine and
                                well. Nothing bad. He was just old and couldn&rsquo;t stand your hard slaps so he
                                fainted due to concussion. Plus it was your phone you were holding that did the damage.
                                It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to talk about it right now. How did you find the dish?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Oh, I found it wonderful. There was never any doubt about it. The veggie Indian
                                curries were perfect. Didn&rsquo;t know you had Indian cooking skills.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I learned it last year. Had nothing to do outside of simple boring tasks so
                                decided to take a go at preparing some Indian dishes. My favorites are puri and moong
                                dal. Lots of fun eating them in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Loved them myself. So, I asked for dinner and you made it happen. Was there a
                                choice since I didn&rsquo;t really ask, it was more like a demand. You are wonderful
                                though, the dinner was more delightful than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&lsquo;Well I always found cooking to be an enjoyable hobby for me so it really
                                wasn&rsquo;t any trouble. Although I hope to come to your apartment some time to enjoy
                                what chef skills you got.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sure, I say come next week if you feel like it.&rdquo;&ldquo;Nah, not next week.
                                Some more time later. Need to free up my mind for this new project of yours. Why are you
                                hurrying about fusion so much? Isn&rsquo;t there so much time for undertaking another
                                huge project? The houses in Kathmandu are still being &lsquo;rearranged&rsquo; as crazy
                                as that sounds.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That project is almost finished now. It&rsquo;s been a year since it was
                                commissioned. We have a much larger and much more important project looming over our
                                heads. We need to give all our attention to it. But right now I&rsquo;m feeling sleepy.
                                Fireup some lullaby in the stereo and let&rsquo;s go to sleep. We only get to sleep
                                together around once a month due to us traveling to different places all the
                                time.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aktir prepared the bed, the bed was colored red which was to
                                Lasin&rsquo;s likening. Lasin got on the bed first. A candle light was glowing form one
                                of the corner. It was electric since nobody wanted their house to go up on fire due to
                                accidental mistakes. Akitir slowly pulled the ribbon away from her hair. She wore a
                                black leather bra under her garment. She removed the silky outer coat. The summer
                                wasn&rsquo;t influencing their dressing choices inside a temperature controlled house.
                                She wore black panties as well. Her earrings shone in the glow of the candle light.
                                Lasin found her beauty mesmerizing. He couldn&rsquo;t hold his gaze. He wanted to pull
                                her into him. And&hellip; he did. After a very long cuddling, they let go of each
                                other&apos;s embrace and talked about their passions, their dreams, their place in
                                nature, philosophy, science, future, past, delight, their favorite writers, political
                                leanings and fell asleep. But even in their sleep, they had momentary lapse of deep
                                immobility which caused them to shift into each other and experience delights even
                                inside their dreams.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin wanted that dream to never end. He never thought unaltered
                                consciousness was capable of experiencing such ridiculous amounts of joy simply through
                                his brain producing joyful chemicals while he spent his time with Akitir. He fantasized
                                about so many things, it was like dreams within dreams and in each of those dreams, he
                                and Akitir had the perfect delightful experience of sharing love with each other. The
                                night was so magnificent that both of them thought it was the peak of their joy.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day arrived after the blissful night ended however, as hard
                                as Lasin and Akirtir wanted it to last for a little long. Akitir didn&rsquo;t know what
                                happened at the office the previous day. She was shocked when she found out about that
                                day&rsquo;s plans. Through some persuasion by Lasin, the company board decided to honor
                                Akitir for her efforts in finding out about Oshok&rsquo;s foul play. During the times
                                the company was small, everyone felt at home and not least with Akitir. Akitir knew
                                everybody and everybody knew her. Many employees admired and commended Akitir for her
                                valiant efforts in structuring the company for maximum profit and good internal
                                environment. Newly arrived interns from various parts of the nation as well as the
                                entire globe liked Akitir and preferred to work with her more than others. She had made
                                a big personality of herself. Her strict mannerism and discipline oriented management
                                style although had some dislikers was mostly taken nicely and was later embedded into
                                her identity. When somebody mentioned Akitir, everybody imagined a committed and
                                no-nonsense lady that was stern in her behavior as well as work ethics. So, when the
                                board decided to honor Akitir, everybody praised the move. It was the first such
                                honoring ceremony in the entire company&rsquo;s history which consisted of little more
                                than 6 years. Lasin was happy that the board chose him to give the medal to Akitir. The
                                crowd cheered, especially the kitchen employees who were betrayed by their disgusting
                                manager. Akitir stepped on the stage after the host, Sarah, spoke her name. Lasin was
                                holding the medal. Akitir walked up to him. Lasin hugged her and congratulated her on
                                her brave and valiant effort. She was not interested in making eye contact with Lasin.
                                Lasin went behind her, facing the crowd. He stretched the medal ribbon across her neck
                                and tied it on her back. Akitir went back to her seat. The ceremony was predicted to
                                have lots of audience so to make it a memorable moment, they had decided to host a
                                talent show along with the honoring. Rabbie sang first. She had a beautiful voice which
                                Akitir liked. No other person in the entire company had a voice like hers. After her,
                                one of the conveyor belt workers, Sarad, went to the stage and performed some break
                                dancing moves. Everybody was delighted by the show put on by him. After some more
                                performances, Lasin himself went back to the stage and gave a short speech about how
                                important it was for other employees to learn from Akitir&rsquo;s bravery and commitment
                                to her duty. Everybody clapped after hearing that. Finally, the board members all went
                                to the stage and one of them, Takayashi Namogochi, a Japanese, concluded the ceremony by
                                offering everybody free beer and juice for non-alcoholics at the cafeteria. Lasin became
                                heavily drunk. His last two days had turned out phenomenal. Akitir didn&rsquo;t attend
                                the party citing that she had some stomach problems. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                            <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c14">Chapter 14</a></h2>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;Familiarity leads to contempt.&rsquo; Lasin thought of this
                                all the time. He was familiar with various technologies. He was familiar with the latest
                                in every department at his company. But he wasn&rsquo;t familiar with certain things.
                                Things like colonizing Andromeda for example. He wanted in some deep part of his heart
                                to colonize the next door big galaxy that one could if desired on a particularly dark
                                night, see the vague outline of. It looked small and tiny seeing from the familiar dirt
                                of Earth but it was immense. It was about twice the size of the milky way in diameter
                                but occupied a tiny patch of the night sky. In the past many mistook it for another star
                                nebula and thus went on to conclude that their galaxy was the entirety of the universe.
                                It wasn&rsquo;t their mistake obviously but this negligence might have slowed down the
                                progress of humanity, Lasin thought. Was there a chance that the inability of the early
                                humans to fathom the actual true size of the universe made them complacent about their
                                actual worthlessness and propelled them into more and more brutish acts of dominance
                                play and war upon each other? Lasin certainly thought it was the case. He wanted more
                                kindness in people after they were made to realize their insignificance in it all. Was
                                their hope? For Lasin there was. If he could invent the cheapest telescope that
                                wasn&rsquo;t hampered by light pollution when gazing at the stars, the stars would be
                                able to gaze back at people&rsquo;s eyes and show them their magnificence. This would
                                propel them to explore those stars and the stars would finally be used for what they
                                were intended for, giving warmth and light to living beings on the planets surrounding
                                it. Beautiful implication of a seemingly small idea, the idea of seeing what existed out
                                there, the unlimited possibilities. He pulled the chair to his desk and in the middle of
                                the night at his home on the edge of the company compound, he scribbled ideas for a
                                telescope. This telescope would be able to see infrared and detect far lights. Soon he
                                realized there were no ways to see the far infrared and radio region of the light
                                spectrum without impacting the size. The size would be massive and massive things cost a
                                lot more, in fact the cost of an object would increase exponentially with its size. No
                                way could a small telescope function as a large telescope. Lasin was admired by his
                                science professor in his school. He told him that he was deemed to do great things in
                                the future, that he was beyond other pupils. But in reality, however hard Lasin tried,
                                he couldn&rsquo;t make hard core facts go away. That Lasin could simply with the turn of
                                his brain gears, make the size-cost exponential graph go away was a pipe dream. Yes,
                                Lasin was able to start a company and gave thousands, possibly a million people jobs,
                                but to say that he was able to change reality&rsquo;s rules was in no way true. General
                                facts were hard to get rid of. So instead of trying to build an ultra powerful telescope
                                so that people would get motivated to reach for the stars, Lasin wanted to do it
                                himself. He was finally going to start a space company. He decided to keep it separate
                                from his many holding company Ytiralugnis. He decided to establish this new company
                                outside the umbrella of Ytiralugnis. He decided to name the new company Andromeda Space
                                Industries. ASI for short. Why did he choose this? It was simple. He always had this
                                dream of reaching to the nearest galaxy and he also knew at the same time that people
                                with poor monkey brains were in no way sufficient for this extremely difficult venture.
                                He knew that in the end, ordinary biological people that didn&rsquo;t possess the
                                intelligence to successfully implement a centralized economy in a country had not even a
                                minute chance of tackling such a big ambition. The ambition was nothing short of
                                impossible. But it had to be done, otherwise the future looked nothing more than bleak.
                                How was he going to get humanity to andromeda? Even if he had an advanced artificial
                                intelligent agent at his fingertips, it was still going to be a massive difficult
                                effort. But forget AAI, he didn&rsquo;t even have the infrastructure required to
                                construct simple chemical based rockets in his country. He would need to wait for years
                                to get a permit and paddle through the bureaucracy, then only he would be allowed to use
                                his big financial funds for the construction of the space garden. Mars had been targeted
                                by NASA and SpaceX since the early 2000&rsquo;s. Bill Clinton had proposed colonization
                                of Mars as the next step that America needed to take to surpass the moon landings of
                                half a century earlier. But after seeing how exponentially difficult the task of landing
                                on mars was compared to simply dropping tin capsules on the low gravity surface of the
                                Moon, he quietly dismantled the proposal. Even with the deep pockets of the most
                                powerful empire of the Earth, space had always been manifested as the most difficult and
                                unforgiving task for poor flea bitten humans. Adapted for tree jumping a mere 3 million
                                years ago, reaching to the moon wasn&rsquo;t any small feat at all but to state that
                                humans were now qualified to reach for the next planet was overestimating. Another key
                                thing to remember was that Nepal didn&rsquo;t have ports to transfer rockets
                                manufactured overseas. And transporting rockets by air was going to add even more
                                overhead to the already exceeding cost of the manufacturing aspect. What was going to
                                solve this? Furthermore, there weren&apos;t any existing aircraft manufacturing plants
                                in Nepal that could be transformed into rocket producing factories. The only industry
                                was metal and Ytiralugnis&rsquo;s electronics class manufacturers procured from China.
                                China had rocket manufacturing ability but there were no wide enough roads cutting
                                through the himalayan wall to accommodate 18 wheeler trucks carrying 9 meter fuselages
                                built of stainless steel. In light of these hurdles, the only significantly cheaper way
                                of getting rockets for Nepal was to build brand new factories and put in place extensive
                                supply chains for bringing aero grade materials to them. How would he go about building
                                it despite the challenges facing him? Lasin was at Akitir&rsquo;s apartment. He wanted
                                to be at her place that night. Akitirs had nothing against it so she happily complied.
                                Lasin prepared dinner that night. He wanted a party at Akitir&rsquo;s flat but he
                                decided not to at the last moment. So right then the two alone were sitting at the bed.
                                He asked about Niban, who Akitir told was at the headquarters. It was night time so it
                                didn&rsquo;t make sense to Lasin why he was at the office at 10 o&rsquo;clock. Akitir
                                replied back,</p>
                            <p>&lsquo;He told me that he had something to finish up before I left at 5 o&rsquo;clock. It
                                was something government related, he said. He added that he would leave at 12
                                o&rsquo;clock so basically he is basically working overtime.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What could it be? If it&rsquo;s government related then it may be some survey
                                stuff regarding the distillation plant for the fusion energy which actually speaking
                                doesn&rsquo;t look too promising right now. We haven&rsquo;t had any new parts delivered
                                and it doesn&rsquo;t look likely that we will achieve the energy output breakthrough
                                within the next decade which if is the case will anger our shareholders that will think
                                that we are investing in ventures that we ain&rsquo;t going to reap rewards from. I need
                                to call him.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>He dialed Niban who immediately picked up the call.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yes, hi Lasin. What made you call at such late night.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Nah, I just.. Akitir told me you are at the office. Why may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Actually I&rsquo;m at my condo right now. Didn&rsquo;t get any shit done today.
                                Maybe tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so urgent? She told me about the government stuff. Is it anything
                                secretive that you are not telling anybody?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that.. I.. um.. Well I&rsquo;m trying to lease land for building a
                                spaceport. Like to land rockets and launch them too.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Thought it wasn&rsquo;t going to pan out. Tricky stuff dealing with the
                                government. Not easy and super slow if you consider the snail&rsquo;s pace of the
                                administration.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We can do something together to fix it. I called you to tell you the exact thing.
                                What are we going to do with our original space center plan? We must be doing something
                                right? I mean it&rsquo;s been more than 5 years and we haven&rsquo;t taken any steps on
                                that.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I would love to talk to you early tomorrow morning. I&rsquo;m super tired right
                                now. Where are you by the way?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at Akitir&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Ah, ok. Call you tomorrow then. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You too. Have a pleasant night.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin looked at Akitir&rsquo;s eyes and stared for sometime. She
                                noted his frustration with regards to his space dream. Such vast magnificent sky above
                                and all they have been doing till now involved building concrete boxes that were
                                producing electronic household gadgets. She found it melancholic too. The romance of the
                                skies was too much for Lasin&rsquo;s heat to ignore. He wanted to break free from the
                                Earth&rsquo;s formidable pull. For her, it wasn&rsquo;t that much of a case. She found
                                it perfectly fine to be stranded on Earth for the rest of her life. How long was her
                                life anyways? She was certain of the sad fact that it wasn&rsquo;t going to be fun after
                                65 years for sure. Why bother with all the depression involving humans remaining on
                                Earth forever if it was such a difficult task to take humans off this rock. She wanted
                                to live a happy life with her love and to see his love suffering from the internal
                                anxiety of the possibility of humans going extinct in the next century due to some huge
                                calamity brought her sadness too. She believed in her fiancee. He was a dreamer but to
                                dream of impossible things and becoming sad for not being able to accomplish them
                                wasn&rsquo;t apt. It wasn&rsquo;t right at all. Lasin wasn&rsquo;t enjoying his busy
                                life that much due to those ruminations. She touched Lasin&rsquo;s cheeks and spoke
                                calmly but firmly,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What happened to my love? Why do you look so sad? Is it the fact that rockets are
                                difficult?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>He didn&rsquo;t speak. He just stared at her.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t be sad in that case. It is just because our brains cannot manage
                                intricate things that require precision. We are built to analyze extreme sensitivity in
                                determining the coefficient of cryogenic mixture while a rocket is zooming through space
                                at 7000 meters per second. It simply isn&rsquo;t in our DNA. We aren&rsquo;t programmed
                                for that. We are just flea bitten monkeys capable of a little more thinking than those
                                hairy mammals. We don&rsquo;t have a numerical processing brain. That&rsquo;s why we
                                needed computers to launch the first rocket which we didn&rsquo;t need when launching
                                the first aircraft in the sky.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>He finally smiled. Then he gave a soft burst of audible launch. Akitir laughed too. They
                                looked at each other&apos;s eyes and brought their arms onto each other.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I wish we were a bit more intelligent. At least at the level where we could
                                comprehend our brain. If that were the case, we would have been able to reverse engineer
                                our brain and instantiate them into computers. No need for human thinking ever
                                again.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I mean if wishes were to come true then I wish that we were born into a galaxy
                                spanning civilization from the beginning. But then if that were the case, we
                                wouldn&rsquo;t have met each other and we wouldn&rsquo;t have been together right
                                now.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Stop such nonsense. It would have been better if we met in that galaxy. At least
                                we could have gone to another starsystem on our dates. How awesome would that have
                                been.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Or we could simply plug into some virtual reality and experience reality bending
                                personas of each other. How close would that bring us together? We could exchange our
                                bodies and experience love from the other&rsquo;s perspective. You would be Akitir and I
                                would be Lasin. Love would remain the same but the world around us two would change.
                                Even have virtual children maybe? Oh I could be a mom and dad at the same time.&rdquo;
                            </p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You want to have babies?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Not in this reality, nah. It&rsquo;s too painful and arduous to have babies here.
                                I meant in virtual reality.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah. That would be fascinating. I can&rsquo;t imagine the possibilities. Being
                                dad at one moment and mom at another. Reading girl stories as mom and boy stories as
                                dad.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That dream may never come, remember? It&rsquo;s just a speculation. Even actual
                                galaxy spanning civilizations right now might have not figured out accurate virtual
                                reality due to their inability to understand consciousness at a fundamental level and
                                how to instantiate it into a computing substrate. But that&rsquo;s highly unlikely. A
                                galaxy spanning culture not having something as fundamental as mind uploading technology
                                is highly unlikely. For us though, it is a pipe dream and will remain so until we reach
                                Andromeda maybe.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah. You made me sad again. Why are we so primitive? I mean it doesn&rsquo;t make
                                any sense how one could remain such primitive creatures for thousands of years of their
                                existence. How could we fight and kill each other for hundreds of thousands of years
                                instead of working towards building better technology?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that we are here thanks to famine and death? I mean our
                                driving force that is evolution is neither technologically efficient nor moral in
                                regards our current morality framework. I mean, gazelles are still suffering at the
                                mouths of lions and cheetah and we don&rsquo;t take and don&rsquo;t intend to take any
                                steps towards reducing their unimaginable suffering. While we blissfully dip the steak
                                rib and chicken wings into the sauce and chew it with delight, there are those feeling
                                and conscious animals are right next in line to become that food on our plates and we
                                don&rsquo;t care an iota about that. Do you really think there is any beauty or cosmic
                                plan in our existence? It&rsquo;s all a complete psychotic frenzy which we are daily
                                part takers of. I mean not only do we sit and do nothing, we actually ourselves do to
                                animals the things we despise when done to other humans. In the past humans at the
                                bottom of the rich pyramid were treated like animals by the people at the top of the
                                hierarchy. It is still the case in caste systems in countries like India and ours. We
                                are labeling people since their birth and hating them for it. I mean how come monkeys
                                are able to explain the formation of babies and do it in a way that involves class
                                distinction? How come stories like this got attention and public adoption?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah doesn&rsquo;t make sense how we are such ignorant assholes. Sometimes I think
                                we never evolved from those monkeys. We are 90 percent the same. Only some neocortex got
                                added to the monkey brain which gave us some leverage over our habitat as well as the
                                ability to suppress our limbic desires. Otherwise we would still be acting like complete
                                maniacs and constantly fighting with each other over trivial matters such as beer
                                drinks. Not the best example I gave right there since we actually fight a lot at pubs.
                                But it would have been insanity if we were unable to stop our fighting urges while being
                                mentally sound. That&rsquo;s why I think we don&rsquo;t care about those cows and pigs
                                suffering at the slaughterhouse. We just don&rsquo;t care about mentally inferior
                                animals even though they are capable of experiencing pain and suffering at the same
                                degree as us.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah. Nature is cruel and we are crueler. Lasin, does consciousness instantiation,
                                sorry for using a computer terminology here due to lack of a better one, during baby
                                formation and time of birth make sense to you? How come we arrived at this moment and
                                neither earlier or later? Do you think time exists coherently after our consciousness
                                extinguishes, again sorry for a bad term, or do you think it is completely meaningless
                                and we were never meant to be born coherently into already determined time stamps? Like
                                why now and not later, say 1000 years later after humanity reaches the stars?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Not sure but I don&rsquo;t think that time is something that manifests physically
                                in a way that it is coherent and forward flowing. The universe is itself infinite so it
                                may have already existed for an infinite time and that the total count of all conscious
                                creatures even just the intelligent ones that ever lived itself exceeds infinity.
                                That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think in a universe of infinte space and infinite time,
                                we were meant to be born at this exact moment. Maybe if our parents had decided to not
                                conceive at all, we would have been at a universe that was a billion years later in the
                                future or backwards in the past. Let&rsquo;s say time was something coherent, the
                                universe is still infinite so whatever event you can think of has reached a time at all
                                stages of its progression. That means the castle that takes a billion years to complete
                                has been completed at one part of the universe and just beginning at another part of the
                                universe even though let&rsquo;s say the universe existed for just 13 billion years.
                                It&rsquo;s because the universe has all the permutations of space and time. A large
                                patch could accelerate extremely fast, even maybe in a computational simulation designed
                                by an advanced civilization to research it&rsquo;s ancestor history which would make the
                                timeline of the universe for the creatures inside the simulation accelerate at whatever
                                pace the aliens desired withstanding the computation limitation of those aliens. It is
                                actually lucky how amenable this universe is. Right now we may close our eyes and dies,
                                sorry for taking about death all of a sudden at midnight but it is necessary, say we
                                die, the next moment we could be at a part of this universe that is unrecognizable to
                                our current form as atoms would be if we were shrunk to the size of a proton. Literally
                                unfathomable if you know what I mean. That is how extreme this stuff can get. The
                                universe has no exceptions and adding another layer of freedom by introducing computer
                                simulation that simulates another reality adhering to now physical laws on top of this
                                already expansive free will mechanism of our brains, this universe is boundless. Simply
                                boundless at what it can do. This whole reality might feel very limited and unremarkable
                                right now with us being on top of a barely large enough rock swinging around a mid size
                                star, but to civilizations capable of bending the laws of physics and changing the
                                fundamental constants at their patch of casual influence, the universe is limitless. No
                                limit, no bound. Nothing to stop them from doing anything, even exceeding the light
                                limit. But as with anything, those civilizations occur at such far distances from each
                                other that the intervening space is just too massive to care about. They certainly
                                influence their 100% of space but nevertheless the universe&rsquo;s infinite size makes
                                it infinitely unrealistic for them to outpace other civilizations to conquer infinity
                                because that is simply impossible for any of them. No light speed modification is able
                                to conquer infinite even if it were possible to make light speed however large barring
                                infinity.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Lasin, that&rsquo;s so deep. Do these thoughts come to your mind in your daily
                                life? I mean it is all so powerful and radical. Normal people don&rsquo;t care enough to
                                even listen to what you have to say on this matter.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopeless with our current infotainment system. No way to disseminate
                                such radical views even with films or books. These are unfathomable topics and to
                                comprehend them requires extensive modification to our meat brains which is again
                                hopeless at the moment with our current technology.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all hopeless then, until we do something to tick our gooey brains
                                faster.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Akitir, it&rsquo;s hopeless until we do something about the problem of death,
                                famine, culture war, poverty, greed, rich-poor divide, extreme capitalism, dictatorship
                                etc. These crippling dysfunctions slow us down even more on top of our already slow
                                composition. A central economy ran by a superintelligent AI cause humans are not
                                intelligent enough for guiding a centrally ran economy, that handled all the rudimentary
                                needs of emotional biological beings like eating, sleeping, housing, education,
                                entertainment, rich medical care would give them leverage and time to think and work on
                                their passion. They could have AIs that helped them to be better at learning. Learning
                                is super difficult, you know? It takes years and years to get 1% of knowledge on
                                something and after your whole life you can barely be called an expert at one field
                                which is a small subsection of all the fields humans have managed to grasp. AIs helping
                                to learn and flourish would produce better and skillful humans that would not be built
                                up by the lust of money and greed. They would be true homo sapiens, the term originally
                                referring to &lsquo;wise men&rsquo;. We would finally be wise. Right now we are not even
                                close becuase of arrogance, deception, delusion, dishonesty, ego, envy, greed, hatred,
                                immorality, lying, selfishness, unreliability, violence, etc. all the traits that were
                                passed down to us from our evolutionary ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;But Lasin, if all is quite good here and we have been surviving as a species
                                despite the desperations of individual human beings, do you think there exists an
                                inherent force that energizes people to press forward with technology to make
                                everybody&rsquo;s livelihood better?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I think so. If there didn&rsquo;t exist such a force, I don&rsquo;t think that
                                humans would be where they are today. Although in contrast to galactic civilization, we
                                are really backwards, we still have to give it to the people that came before us who
                                paved the way for us to carry on with the pace of innovation they set in place at their
                                time. We are quite lucky that we weren&rsquo;t born into the middle ages. Those
                                centuries were truly desperate even for those with an iron heart. If you transported a
                                rich child from today who has access to anything he desires with his mum&rsquo;s credit
                                card to the middle of 1308 then he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive a day. The stress
                                of a completely different era coupled with the middle ages&rsquo; particularly sinister
                                qualities would turn anybody from today into a soulless zombie. Eating would be
                                difficult. Sleeping peacefully would be difficult. He would be constantly haunted with
                                nightmares about not being able to get love, attention, kindness, quality food, movies,
                                a car, a fancy suburban house, restaurant dishes etc. Within a few days, psychosis would
                                set in and death from depression would ensue.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Death from depression? That&rsquo;s such a haunting phrase. Explain it to me
                                further please.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Do you really want to enter the deep terrifying rabbithole of extreme depression
                                sickness in the middle of the night?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah sure. No problem. What could go wrong?&rdquo; She smiled slightly and her
                                teeth shone due to gleaming candle light emanating from the bedside desk. Lasin sighed a
                                deep sigh and began to speak.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;There is something called Death from Depression. Let&rsquo;s call it DFD to make
                                it easy to pronounce every time. DFD ensues in the late phase of a person&rsquo;s manic
                                episode initiated by a trauma. The trauma could be anything ranging from grief of a
                                close one&rsquo;s death, self hate, PTSD, childhood experience, orphanage, constant
                                bullying, social anxiety, failure to achieve lifelong dreams etc. The trauma is the
                                starter of any depression. Sometimes depression can arise naturally in one&rsquo;s
                                mind-brain connection due to chemical changes but then again much of the time it is
                                initiated by a trauma. Now, the trauma if it is not addressed stars to give stress.
                                Stress increases difficulties in one&rsquo;s life. One is not able to function properly
                                when he is not in a good mood due to stress. If one gets stressed continuously for years
                                on end, it develops into an early depressive disorder. This disorder hampers oneself
                                much more than any form of daily stress. It develops quickly inito more and more
                                stronger depression until finally one is crippled by it from within the mind-brain
                                connection. Now why I&rsquo;m saying mind-brain connection is because we really
                                don&rsquo;t know if this disease solely exists in one&rsquo;s mind and that is it is
                                invisible and effects only consciousness which manifests into one&rsquo;s perception of
                                the world or that it exists in the brain, thus affecting neurons which affects the
                                behavior and outlook of one through that route. It is really hard to tell. These two
                                routes are intricately linked that the crippling suffering that depression induces
                                exists solely in one&rsquo;s consciousness. This suffering gets more and more intense
                                without giving physical pain. It escalates to such levels that one finds it impossible,
                                literally impossible to generate a conscious will to move his body and limbs to get out
                                of his bed from morning to evening. This is why depression is far more vicious than any
                                other disease. It literally locks you into a position for the rest of your day until you
                                have to get up to force feed yourself or die from hunger and muscle cramps. Now eating
                                by forcing yourself to eat isn&rsquo;t going to give you the pleasure you normally
                                experience when you eat while you&rsquo;re hungry. Watching your favorite show to force
                                yourself to laugh for the first time in 6 months isn&rsquo;t going to make you actually
                                laugh. Laugh is the manifestation of happiness which emerges from the deep conscious
                                brain which is where depression wrecks its havoc not allowing an iota of happy thoughts
                                to flow out of it, forget any happiness coming out of that mind. Mental sickness in its
                                most terrifying form. Completely aware of the surroundings so one doesn&rsquo;t get the
                                relief of becoming fully disjointed from the harsh reality picture he has constructed in
                                his depressed mind unlike other maniac patients who get the relief because their minds
                                have been completely damaged to the point that rational thinking itself has been
                                completely sabotaged by their sickness. Depression patients are completely rational
                                which is why their suffering is much intense and real. Eating by forcing is very
                                difficult if you have ever tried. You may have found trying to force feed yourself
                                something you completely loathe horrendously difficult. Well, present the depression
                                patient with the world&rsquo;s best tasty dish prepared by a michelin 5 star chef and
                                they will still feel like vomiting. In fact, they vomit immediately after they eat. This
                                is called gag reflex vomiting. It&rsquo;s when you are afraid or anxious and feel very
                                sad. Try to eat a whole pizza when you just found out that you son has died and tears
                                are rolling down your eyes in streams. Your gag reflex will kick in and you will vomit
                                each bite immediately without swallowing. The depressive patient is continually losing
                                his/her mental child and thus they can&rsquo;t eat when they have to eat. They become
                                very weak and in cases they lose their mental faculty due to hunger and thus die from
                                paralysis. Other cases where people can at least eat and fulfill their basic biological
                                requirements, they still feel each and every discomfort their mind produces. The
                                suffering reaches such extreme levels that death becomes their ultimate relief.
                                Medicines could have prevented their deaths if taken early but after suffering for too
                                long in silence, their hope is now already shattered and death seems to them like a
                                beautiful angel doctor that&rsquo;s going to get rid of their tortured existence with
                                the swift blow of her kiss. The depressive patient thus chooses death and kills himself
                                in any way that seems fit. This DFD ends the depression through death of the patient.
                                One could even kill himself by cutting his neck with a knife lying by his bedside and
                                thus die with the most horrendous pain simply because tying up a noose becomes too much
                                of an effort.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Holy shit. I never knew this sickness was so scary. Why don&rsquo;t they take
                                medicine early?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Early is a tricky question. When is it early? When you are suffering stress that
                                may or may not lead to depression or when you are in the early forms of depression?
                                It&rsquo;s really hard to know that you got depression without meeting a psychiatrist
                                which many hesitate to do.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;And on top of that, our culture despises depression patients. It treats them like
                                weaklings.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, we have to fix that or else many more generations will suffer unwanted
                                suffering.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c15">Chapter 15</a></h2>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The night had ended in that hemisphere. Lasin and Akitir both awoke
                                at the same time but one of them kept themself to the bed. Lasin was that person once
                                again. Akitir jerked the blanket from her chest and in one leap came swiftly out of the
                                bed. Lasin was gazing at her, seeing her energy but didn&rsquo;t make any effort to
                                move. He was almost bound to the bed. He used to get very deep sleep when he thought
                                about deep things before bed. Lasin was that kind of person, one who didn&rsquo;t get
                                his sleep disturbed by unwanted thoughts at sleep hour but instead just the opposite. So
                                when Akitir brought coffee to his bedside, he had to finally force himself to put some
                                strain to get up otherwise Akitir might just get out of his life. Or that was just
                                overthought. He nonetheless saw no option other than to stay with her for the rest of
                                his life. It was almost like destiny had brought them together. Lasin was a charming guy
                                and so was Akitir. She was tall and fair, had straight hair and showed keen interest in
                                fashion and dress choice. Lasin, although handsome, didn&apos;t really care about his
                                attire. Since men almost always wore the same dress, they tended to be less concerned
                                with their dress up in comparison to women. That was an undeniable fact. Finally after
                                what looked like to be an extensive ordeal, Lasin managed to sit up straight in his bed
                                and sipped the coffee. Now that might seem like an oxymoron. Who on earth drank coffee
                                without even brushing thier teeth or rinsing their face in the morning. Well, Lasin was
                                that man. Akitir shouldn&rsquo;t have brought that coffee to a still sleeping man but
                                since she did, Lasin had no other choice than to do what followed. After talking some
                                small talk and drinking their coffees, they both thought of what they wanted to do now.
                                Lasin had certainly dreamed about the space center that night but Akitir on the other
                                hand wasn&rsquo;t interested in that personally. She however, if ordered by him, would
                                have to give her full attention to the task of managing the logistics of the operation
                                as efficiently as possible. That was what she was good at. Not having any personal
                                choice and leanings but to do what the administration asked her to do. Being the leading
                                decision maker although with some restrictions from the board, had made Lasin complacent
                                with his abilities. He was certainly making good decisions for the company but that was
                                certainly not irrefutable evidence that what he was doing was optimal. Eventually due to
                                his complacency, he might commit some dread mistake that might make the company go
                                bankrupt. That was always a possibility so he had to be considerable of that. Nobody was
                                perfect, even contemporary but old and experienced entrepreneurs he admired like Elon
                                Musk and Masayoshi Son had committed grave mistakes that put their company stock at
                                jeopardy. Were those mistakes on the same caliber of damage if they were committed at
                                his company? Maybe not, since Ytiralugnis was now massive and any blunder might do more
                                than necessary damage. Lasin started,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Hey Aktiir, I think I might need to think deeply about this space thing that our
                                company is certainly going to move on with as it&rsquo;s next primary focus. For the
                                next few days, I might be busy and so if you need some help regarding work, just call
                                Niban okay? I think I&rsquo;m going to tour Nepal after so long to see where the
                                construction of this space launching colossus is going to be optimal. So that&rsquo;s my
                                agenda from today.&rdquo; Akitir looked at her empty coffee mug and replied back,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;As you please. I also got some chores to handle at the office. Might take a few
                                days to clear up those. You do what you have to do. I think we have a good future with
                                this space plan. Building, launching, testing, iterating is quite different from our
                                previous experience with designing, manufacturing, distributing workflow. We will have
                                to get used to the new one and soon if we are to corner the market before new innovative
                                space startups.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get in a hurry. I know your work passion and mindset but this thing is
                                difficult. Elon Musk has the only successful space startup in my opinion. All others are
                                just the freeloaders feeding off his company&rsquo;s growth.&rdquo; Akitir made a blank
                                face. She had a different opinion. She also thought Lasin was a bit more hasty in his
                                space passion.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah but that might change for sure right? Today with bleeding edge technologies
                                like ion propulsion and cheap 3d printed carbon fiber rockets, we might be left behind
                                if we don&rsquo;t hurry.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Really? You call ion propulsion a bleeding edge technology? And 3d printed rockets
                                cheap? They are cheap to manufacture, yes but when you try to scale 3d printed rockets,
                                you quickly hit a money wall. There simply aren&rsquo;t big 3d printers to print 50
                                storey rockets. They are way too expensive to make any sense.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah but that might also change. Someday we might have massive colossus rockets
                                built using modular 3d printers that are able to climb the rocket they just built to add
                                on top of the stack. I mean what&rsquo;s stopping that from happening is just its
                                economy right? I mean the innovation has been done already. What&rsquo;s remaining is
                                just implementation. Just implementation? That&rsquo;s the most difficult part. It takes
                                the most amount of time and isn&rsquo;t going to be as easy as you think. To take an
                                idea from design phase to mass implementation requires solid planning. You can&rsquo;t
                                start building factories when you don&rsquo;t know what you are building is going to
                                work reliably and isn&rsquo;t some party trick. Things have to be resistant to work
                                defects. Who knows these untested printing robots are going to work as planned in the
                                field. I don&rsquo;t think so myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akitir had listened to what he just said intently. She definitely
                                agreed with his statement that innovation was difficult to implement in the field.
                                Landing rockets propulsively had been conducted on test model rockets even in the
                                90&rsquo;s but their first commercial use happened only since 2016 with SpaceX&rsquo;s
                                landing their falcon rocket boosters on top of ocean barges.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Ok you outline the draft. I will work with the parts suppliers as soon as you are
                                ready.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sure. Thanks. I think our company will finally be headed into a straight direction
                                now that we have a common goal. The common goal of colonizing the Andromeda galaxy. What
                                a bizarre notion right?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t bizarre at all. It is like setting a direction on a compass. When
                                you have to go north to reach your house or somewhere, you use a compass, nowadays GPS
                                but in the old days, compass were present in everybody&rsquo;s pockets. The compass
                                points to the north but you don&rsquo;t plan to reach the north pole. It&rsquo;s the
                                same here.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same actually. I think we will genuinely build rockets capable
                                of traversing the vast distance between Milky way and the Andromeda galaxy. I think even
                                if we knowingly work against that goal, our goal of reaching the next planet in the most
                                efficient way will push us towards it. Thus I think trying to reach for the Andromeda
                                galaxy is not out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Wow. Never heard such an argument before. Ok then. Let&rsquo;s go to
                                Andromeda.&rdquo; She laughed showing her teeths. Her black eyes were watching Lasin
                                intently. Lasin laughed back.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I am not joking, Akitir. I&rsquo;m serious about stuff like this.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Nah. I ain&rsquo;t joking either. The premise seemed too ridiculous so I
                                couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I need to go to the toilet and stuff. See you in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>After finishing the morning ritual and taking a shower, Lasin appeared back the living
                                room and saw Akitir serving breakfast.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Just some poached eggs and bread. You like this, am I right?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Lasin didn&rsquo;t actually prefer poached eggs to friend ones but realizing the efforts
                                Akitir put on to prepare those, he decided to be affirmative.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah why not. I like varieties for sure. They look delicious by the way.&rdquo;
                            </p>
                            <p>They had their breakfast from the same plate. It wasn&rsquo;t something common but they
                                found no repulsion at doing that. Taking a big bite of the bread, mixing it with the egg
                                yolk, Akitir spoke.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Lasin, I think that your ridiculous aim of reaching the Andromeda galaxy will not
                                have any believers around your circle.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t worry about that.&rdquo; Chewing his food, he added. &ldquo;Also,
                                remember the Steve Jobs quote about first them not believing you, then ridiculing you
                                and finally saying it was the case all along or something like that. I think having big
                                goals does no harm.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Comeon, that quote wasn&rsquo;t made for somebody like you who says humanity
                                should try to reach Andromeda when we haven&rsquo;t even colonized our neighboring
                                planet.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We will soon, don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I mean I don&rsquo;t care. I will just happily ride along until I die.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will die though. You have plenty of time to reach the
                                longevity escape velocity. What is your age right now? 26?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Nah I&rsquo;m 27. I don&rsquo;t think I will live till 2100 to catch the longevity
                                escape velocity or whatever. I even think it&apos;s a pipe dream.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;No it&apos;s not. Who made you think that?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I myself. I can think for myself. Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah but you are the technologically savvy person with two degrees, how come you
                                are the luddite and I the progressive?&rdquo;&ldquo;Look, I am not a luddite, ok? I just
                                think that this longevity escape velocity is much more difficult to achieve than people
                                give it credit for. I think it will take the ballpark of around another century.&rdquo;
                            </p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah. I understand. But I still disagree.&rdquo; Lasin had already finished
                                his portion by this time and Akitir was closing in. He waited for some time till she
                                gulped the last portion. Then he continued. &ldquo;Ok so let&apos;s part then. I might
                                see you in the office.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Alright, see you there.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin got up and since he was already dressed up after coming from
                                the shower, he pulled his overcoat from the hangar and slipped it over his body. He got
                                out of the door and waved hands to Akitir and dropped straight down from the elevator.
                                Later he arrived at the office in his car. He didn&rsquo;t have any administrative
                                duties left that day so he decided to do a field tour to check out the land that Niban
                                was trying to lease from the government. Niban was there at the office. They two met at
                                the main meeting room and without any ado, started their discussion. Lasin started,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Niban, yesterday you told me that you found out about a suitable land that you
                                think is going to be good for constructing a launch testing facility. Where is that? We
                                need to go there and possibly finalize everything. I am not joking around this time.
                                Space is the only next step for this company. No AI, no quantum computing, nothing. Only
                                old school space. Let&rsquo;s reach for Mars and beyond if possible.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ok
                                sure. The area is the same as the last time. That Nuwakot hill we visited many years
                                ago. Remember something? We talked about how we were going to transport the rockets in
                                the cable cars since there weren&rsquo;t any roads to accommodate large transporters. I
                                am most certain that there still aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s the same place? You should have told me earlier. I am actually
                                quite nostalgic about that place. You are from Buwal so it&rsquo;s right at your alley.
                                We talked with the mayor last time. Who are you talking with this time?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The mayor got replaced with a new one in the recent election. I have fostered a
                                good relationship with this one. He agrees with a lot of my evaluations. I think we have
                                a good chance to hit a deal. The work can then begin soon after that.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Wow. Never in my dreams I thought we would end up at the same spot we began with.
                                I am actually quite nostalgic about that place. It looks really wonderful and sublime
                                like California.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;You have been to California? I thought you personally never visited the US.&rdquo;
                            </p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Actually I had to go to Cali on an urgent basis. No time to make any appointments
                                or anything.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s silly. I never knew you&rsquo;ve been to the US. I personally
                                haven&rsquo;t been there.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Oh you must go some time. I will arrange the visa. So many states and so much
                                diversity.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sure. So what about hitting the roads today in the evening? We will stay at a
                                hotel in Traffic Chowk when we arrive at around 12 o&rsquo;clock and then hit the Tinau
                                bridge the next day to set off to Nuwakot.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sounds like a plan. I&rsquo;m all in for it.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Ok then let&rsquo;s hurry up. Need to pack some stuff and survey gear too this
                                time to take the measurements.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We are not taking any surveyors?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;In this preliminary phase? I rather not. First we have to strike a deal with the
                                mayor. We might even do it tomorrow if the bureaucratic machine ran faster. If we
                                don&rsquo;t have to wait another 5 to 10 days, we can then call our surveyors and they
                                will mark the spot for the construction of our already designed space complex. We
                                already have it sitting in our CAD folder at the office. Man, I wish physical stuff
                                moved along at the pace of digital stuff. It always lags behind 5 years or more.&rdquo;
                            </p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it has been since the beginning. So nothing to compare it with
                                and complain about. Either major changes have to be injected to the reality software
                                that determines causal flow of events or it will remain like this forever. Maybe in
                                virtual reality, things will massively alter from what we are used to. This will surely
                                have a far greater impact than what trying to improve on the physical layer will.&rdquo;
                            </p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Affirmative sir.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Stop talking like a robot.&rdquo; Lasin squinted his eyes.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Sorry, I was just excited to be finally doing what we wanted to do 5 years or so
                                ago.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That time we didn&rsquo;t have the capital. We even thought of using crypto to
                                funnel in money from foreign investors.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That was definitely going to work. It was my idea after all.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I think not. It was a silly idea to use crypto in a country where it is
                                banned.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I mean they cannot tax it or anything right? So who needs to disclose that we are
                                using it?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, agreed.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s get to work then.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin went to his apartment and packed some clothes. It was all like
                                the first day again. He was excited and had a plan this time. He was going to press on
                                whatever came in his way. Nobody was going to tell Lasin nothing. His childhood dream
                                was now inches away if luck was in his favor. &lsquo;It could be right?&rsquo; Lasin
                                thought. He was a sensitive guy. He didn&rsquo;t like anybody talking against him. So in
                                the end it was him who was his ship steward and he was going to sail right, sail amazing
                                seas and sail through the tallest mountains. Now it was all in Lasin&rsquo;s hands. The
                                call from Niban came and Lasin hopped into Niban&rsquo;s car waiting outside his
                                apartment. Niban was the driver. Lasin sat in the passenger seat at the front. Niban had
                                a coffee ready incase Lasin made a sleepy excuse to not listen to his talk.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Where were you yesterday? I guess at Akitir&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I just guessed. It&rsquo;s a safe guess at any time.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, she invited me and I couldn&rsquo;t say no.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;She has lots of duties in front of her now. She must start to prepare herself from
                                right now. She will be the launch contracts manager since right now I don&rsquo;t think
                                of a good enough person at the company to take the job. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong but I
                                don&rsquo;t think this will add to her already overloaded duties.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;She should be able to handle it all. She is a hardworking woman.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;If you wanna drive then let me know. How&rsquo;s the coffee by the way? I bought
                                it at the canteen.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Really? They improved it so much. It feels like it&apos;s from a cafe.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited. I was joking. They never have coffee this good there. I
                                bought it at the local starbucks.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Shit you got me. Starbucks has opened their cafes in Nepal. That&rsquo;s so crazy
                                actually.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Well, it opened just last month and that&apos;s not a good thing. Foreign
                                companies have taken hold of our markets. Local coffee shops simply can&rsquo;t keep up
                                with their speed. They have a few more in Kathmandu and Pokhara. Butwal will get some in
                                the near future.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;When is Mcdonalds coming to Nepal Niban? I want to try the beef burgers they make.
                                I tried one in Cali and found them delightful actually. Sorry by the way for eating a
                                cow. Don&rsquo;t believe that shit actually.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Neither do I but I don&rsquo;t think I will be able to try a beef burger any time
                                soon. I have really not got guts to try to eat a national animal you know. I mean how
                                crazy it is? We have put the cow as our national animal and foreigners eat it.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;To be frank, I don&rsquo;t think it is written anywhere that one should not eat
                                their national animal or bird for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t have any strong opinion on that but I just think that one must
                                not eat something that is a country&rsquo;s emblem. But I don&rsquo;t have anything
                                against Mcdonald&apos;s serving beef burgers here. I don&rsquo;t think that&apos;s going
                                to be any worse than what is already happening here with buffalos. Cows are revered as
                                gods but buffalos are treated as just fodder. Now that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at
                                all.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Niban, I think that&rsquo;s why KFC is generally more popular than Mcdonalds in
                                all the countries. They don&rsquo;t offend anyone by serving dinosaur birds to
                                eat.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;True that. Any whoo what do you think of the last general elections? Still the
                                same old politicians got the majority of votes from their region. When will this change?
                                Many people are so illiterate in the far west and far east regions. This saddens me to
                                the core. If this improved then the whole country&apos;s economy would skyrocket since
                                education uplifts the whole society. Skyrocket, which we are trying to do from tomorrow.
                                Hope we will be successful.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be credulous. Who knows if the educated people still find other ways
                                to halt the country&rsquo;s economy by leaning even more towards the socialist ideology
                                of the Marksist and communist philosophy. That type of communist union would be far more
                                detrimental than a big portion of the illiterate populace not contributing anything to a
                                country&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Your logic doesn&rsquo;t make sense. If that was the danger then how are big
                                capitalist countries like the US and Japan thriving on their oppressive and extremely
                                unbalanced capitalist creed? How come Google and Microsoft&rsquo;s headquarters
                                aren&rsquo;t stormed by large worker union groups? How are the oppressed not resisting
                                the oppressors even though they are wholly aware of their jarring pay and rights
                                violation?&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because although the pay is unequal and completely made up, everybody
                                gets happy when they get promoted at their level. Nobody is stuck at their initial level
                                forever. One day their pay gets increased and they become happy and satisfied. Another
                                not quite true but nonetheless an important factor is the fact that they are free to
                                leave their job at any time they want provided they have saved enough to survive until
                                they find their next job. Which if you ask me isn&rsquo;t really the case. One finds it
                                very difficult to quit their stable job that&apos;s providing them food and basic
                                amenities plus some luxury because they fear that the next job won&rsquo;t be on par
                                with what they are already getting. So they just carry on with being oppressed by their
                                employees.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;That makes sense. So why doesn&rsquo;t that argument work with Nepalese?&rdquo;
                                Niban asked with a curious face.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The reason is because Nepal isn&rsquo;t rich enough to give time to time
                                promotions to keep the blue color job holders happy. Also the quality of living they get
                                there isn&rsquo;t on par with the rich countries. This all adds up quickly and if one
                                day a union group storms one of the budding factories, the slowly growing market would
                                suffer deleterious effects. Nowadays, protests can spread like wildfire. A small strike
                                by some workers at one factory might lead to a massive protest across the country
                                thereby pushing the entire nation into a temporary depression. If things aren&rsquo;t
                                quickly amended after that, this might even lead to a long term economic
                                stagnation.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Now I feel the risk. Man economy is so tricky. It&rsquo;s not just about factories
                                and products. It&rsquo;s about pay violations, worker feelings, etc. Do you want to take
                                the wheel? I am feeling tired driving for 2 hours straight. Might need some sleep.
                                I&rsquo;m feeling tired today. It&rsquo;s 11 o&rsquo;clock right now.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After parking their car on the side of the road, they exchanged their
                                seats and Lasin took the wheel.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Lasin. We will reach it in 1 and a half hours now. Wake me up then ok.
                                Don&rsquo;t sleep in the car. It won&rsquo;t be comfortable in the morning with all the
                                back pains. Plus we need to eat dinner too.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You have your rest.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lasin drove fast. There were speed limits but no body and no speed
                                guns to implement them. They reached their destination in just 45 minutes. He woke Niban
                                up. Niban lifted his head and looked around with a drowsy face. He spoke,</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;We arrived already?&rdquo; After checking his phone&rsquo;s lock screen he
                                continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just 11:46. At what time did you grab the wheel? 11 right.
                                Man, you drove fast.&rdquo; He finished with a shocked face.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;I just wanted to reach early. Now that we are here before midnight, we might not
                                have too much trouble trying to find a suitable hotel. Let&rsquo;s check that one. The
                                board has Ambika guest house or something written on it.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Lasin, damn. You should have driven slowly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He got out of the car and they both opened the back hood of the car.
                                After carrying their respective bags, they headed to the guest house. After checking in,
                                they both crashed into their room and face slammed at the separate beds throwing their
                                shoes underneath.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The morning arrived. It was already 9 o&rsquo;clock so that meant
                                they slept for 8 hours. They were almost ready to set off to the mayor&rsquo;s office
                                when suddenly a rain blizzard hit. It was monsoon that time of the year. Nepal had a
                                monsoon season which brought with it massive amounts of rainfall making it difficult for
                                vehicles to drive on the road. They waited for around 2 hours for the rain to subside
                                and when it did at around 1 o&rsquo;clock, they got into the car and drove to the
                                mayor&rsquo;s office. The new mayor was a cool and calm guy. He was eager to see new
                                developments in his region. Seeing Lasin, one of Nepal&rsquo;s leading entrepreneurs
                                come to his office, he couldn&rsquo;t hold his joy. He welcomed both of them. The talk
                                went on for an hours when the approval came through. It wasn&rsquo;t that fast after
                                that. For swiftly beginning operations regarding construction of the new site, the mayor
                                had to refer to the federal government to allow the use of the land under a new clause
                                of space centers. Nepal had never amended its constitution for space construction
                                because it simply didn&rsquo;t have one. Now it was finally happening so whatever the
                                government needed to do, it had to do it fast.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So the talks and everything after that day went fast. The next month
                                they also received the approval to build. Now it was about building and focussing on
                                designing the best rockets to launch to the space. Over the last 5 years, Lasin had been
                                thinking out loud about space, now was his opportunity to make it happen. The company
                                earlier established a space branch completely separate as Lasin wanted from the main
                                company. It was titled ASI. Advanced Space Industries comprised as of then just 10
                                employees mainly working on CAD models of rocket towers that were to be built on
                                Nowagaun. The team was greatly expanded to 90 employees by the time they were ready to
                                begin the construction on Nowagaun. The construction comprised of a launch tower
                                obviously but also an engine testing stand about 1 kilometer away from the main launch
                                tower. The construction materials were hauled on top of the Nowagaun using the
                                conventional road that led up to the mountain top. It took time but it was feasible.
                                Small test engines would also be no trouble for being carried on top of the hill.
                                Finally when the construction finished about a month later than expected, the ASI was
                                ready to build its engine that it had designed since August. It was late September so no
                                better time start manufacturing the engines. Although the engines themselves
                                weren&rsquo;t ready, the place for building those engines was. A small tent factory
                                about the size of a small school yard was being made ready at the hill&rsquo;s base
                                around the same time as the tower construction. The factory contained highly precise
                                machining tools for drilling out engine nozzles and combustion chambers from raw metal
                                slabs.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full-flow rocket engine&rsquo;s most vital part, the pre burners that
                                acted as the preliminary combustion chamber before the ignition of the main combustion
                                chamber had to be very durable to prevent explosion. The problem inside a rocket engine
                                was always explosion, never implosion. The fuselage could suffer from implosion due to
                                pressure variance from the atmospheric pressure but the inside of a rocket engine always
                                comprised of higher pressure than the surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ASI&rsquo;s engine wasn&rsquo;t any fancy FFSCE (Full Flow Staged
                                Combustion Engine) that was the hallmark of modern rocket engines. It was instead a
                                simple pressure fed rocket engine. It contained a chamber whose walls were a millimeter
                                thick to contain the extremely pressurized hydrogen and oxygen fuel. The hydrogen and
                                oxygen chambers were separately located inside the rocket but the nozzle obviously was
                                the same. Nepal had no metal supply chains to provide for ASI&rsquo;s demands. So
                                Ytiralugnis, the parent company, transported that month&rsquo;s demanded quantity
                                directly from China. So, ASI could now focus on machining.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through the strenuous efforts of the ASI employees, a prototype
                                engine was machined and made ready for testing by the end of the week. Hauling just an
                                engine from the base to the top of the hill wasn&rsquo;t difficult since it was small.
                                Transporting the massive pressurized chamber was difficult. That was the reason why the
                                company wanted to bring the defunct cable car line into operation as soon as possible.
                                But to make that happen, they need to prove their ability to launch at least a prototype
                                rocket. Otherwise the local government would rather prefer to go with the original plan
                                of building a ropeway and removing the launch and testing site from the face of the hill
                                or otherwise convert it to a museum.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wth massive effort, the engine and tank were finally transported to
                                the top of the hill. Now they needed to be hooked onto the testing pad and ignited with
                                a spark plug. Before that however, they first needed to make sure that the exhaust
                                plumes from the engine didn&rsquo;t interfere with the picnic spot one kilometer away.
                                Since Nowagaun was a tall hill, the engineers at ASI guessed that simply the atmospheric
                                drag of the wind would be enough to blow the plumes away from gathering spots. If that
                                didn&rsquo;t happen and the plumes did reach people, that would be a massive health
                                hazard.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After about 5 days since the gear was transported, the testing was
                                about to commence. The engineers and some local people gathered about 2 km away for
                                safety to see the engine testing. After the countdown reached 0 and everybody held their
                                breaths, the engine roared and massive white plumes could be seen reaching the sky. The
                                test was a complete success and that was the first try. The sight was thrill inducing.
                                The first ever testing of a rocket engine built from scratch in Nepal. That wasn&rsquo;t
                                something one born 20 years earlier could hope to see in their lifetime. What Lasin,
                                Niban and the engineers at ASI did with their dedication and hard work was very
                                commendable. The space enthusiasm grew 100 fold around the small nation after that day.
                                The social media feed was flooded by the engine firing shots and the Nowagaun hill
                                launch center. Right then the launch center wasn&rsquo;t equipped for launching orbital
                                rockets. It could only allow for the engine to be stacked on top of it and nothing more.
                                But expansion was already on the way.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cottage that Lasin and Niban rented on that hill 6 years ago to
                                see and learn the feasibility of the area to launch rockets was still there. Now it
                                would be seeing massive growth in its income in the coming days and hopefully for the
                                coming years. Lasin was overcome with joy with what was happening. He expected the
                                chamber to burst or something but he never imagined that it was going to move
                                flawlessly.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was black tar everywhere below the testing stand from the
                                ground grass burning in the scorching exhaust. The team didn&rsquo;t concrete plate the
                                launch base. They might have to now since the site was surely going to be converted into
                                an orbital launching facility.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akitir was very delighted to see how the supply chain she arranged
                                delivered on its promise perfectly. The whole ordeal took a lot of her work time and it
                                constantly made her tired. To see everything working flawlessly, she couldn&rsquo;t be
                                more happy. She was going to be contracts manager when the rockets were finally going to
                                launch to space. She didn&rsquo;t know herself if she was prepared for the chore but she
                                was confident that she could tackle any new obstacle thrown at her face. Perseverance
                                was her strength. She could persevere through anything.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                            <h2 class="section-heading"><a id="c16">Chapter 16</a></h1>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Big news everybody. The orbital launching facility is
                                    complete and ready to go.&rdquo; Lasin expressed with excitement at the company
                                    meeting at ASI. The members at the meeting were filled with enthusiasm at what lay
                                    ahead of them. They had worked on this goal for many years and to say that it was
                                    finally happening didn&rsquo;t feel real to many of them. Akitir personally was
                                    overcome with emotions. She had worked to make this happen for months. ASI consisted
                                    of the same executive people as Ytiralugnis with some more heads added to the mix.
                                    All the managerial positions were filled by the exact same people. Lasin as the
                                    director as well as chief product architect. He oversaw all the rocket developments
                                    and made sure to make it all go smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the proverb &lsquo;All good things come to an end&rsquo; said,
                                    the next rocket engine the company was trying to test wasn&rsquo;t panning out as
                                    planned. It was a gas generator power cycle engine which used kerosene and liquid
                                    oxygen as its fuel. The kerosene turbine wasn&rsquo;t rotating fast enough which was
                                    causing a lot of headache at ASI. Since the gas turbine wasn&rsquo;t in sync with
                                    the LOX turbine, the two gasses weren&rsquo;t mixing properly which was causing the
                                    engine to stall. Propellent engineer Ramsay Swami who was leading the fuel
                                    department wasn&rsquo;t sure if they had made the right choice by using kerosene
                                    instead of other alternatives. Stalling wasn&rsquo;t good obviously but what was
                                    bugging the entire team was the possibility of an explosion. If that happened then
                                    the testing pad might be damaged. That would set back their timeline by months which
                                    would cause delays in the commercial contracts. Everybody knew that should be
                                    avoided at all costs.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran the gas generator and monitored the readings at the
                                    wall mounted monitor. The readings looked good but the problem of the gas turbine
                                    speed lagging behind the lox turbine speed was present. A thought suddenly arose in
                                    the mind of Fluid mechanics engineer Hans Sharma. He thought that the possibility of
                                    the density of kerosene was not making it easy for the turbine to rotate. Maybe it
                                    was pushing too hard but the swirl or curl in technical language was not enough
                                    thereby stalling the rotor blade. To fix this one would need to design the blades in
                                    such a manner as to compensate for the lack of rotation force. The idea was to make
                                    the blades even curvier. Curvier blades would allow for more force to be generated
                                    when the gas pushed on it. The solution was proven to be correct, the machining
                                    department produced the thinner and curvier turbine blades and replaced the old
                                    ones. The team was back on motion. They were also a bit worried. If such an
                                    intricate problem could stop them from making further progress in the testing, how
                                    would they achieve the daunting task of reaching orbit?&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reaching orbit wasn&rsquo;t easy. Many startups had tried before
                                    to do exactly that but they were all unsuccessful. The most notable was the Jeff
                                    Bezos company Blue Origin. It had only one rocket that was operational and it could
                                    not reach orbit. So how on earth was ASI, a company based in one of the poorest
                                    nations supposed to beat Blue Origin to orbit? Well, through ingenuity and
                                    perseverance of the team members.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before testing the gas generator engine however, the team had to
                                    integrate electronics into the engine. Without advanced electronics, no sensor data
                                    could be read thus making it impossible to know what went right and what went wrong.
                                    So to do that, the electronics department of Ytiralugnis was called at ASI to
                                    develop small micro electronics using modern fabrication techniques so that the best
                                    of the latest sensor and monitoring techniques could be applied to their gas
                                    generator engine. This had to be successful. The cost of the engine when finished
                                    completely would come at around 1 crore which was a massive sum. The team had to
                                    make sure to make it work in the first or at least in the second try.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The work was finished. The engine was completely equipped and its
                                    final form was ready to be transported to the top of the hill for testing. Never
                                    before in the history of rocket science, rockets were transported to higher
                                    elevation for testing or launching. They were always carried out at lower elevation
                                    and that also closer to the equatorial line. ASI was doing just the opposite.
                                    Increasing the elevation and further complicating the launch procedure.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The testing of the second more advanced gas generator engine was
                                    conducted successfully. The first ever in Nepal. Now what was remaining was to move
                                    onto cryogenic LOX and kerosene to store as much amount as possible into the rocket
                                    fuel tanks. If this was accomplished successfully, this would make history by
                                    bringing into the world, an orbital class cryogenic liquid propulsion rocket from a
                                    country that couldn&rsquo;t produce automobiles. This would give Nepal limitless
                                    capability of launching satellites into space. What would other countries gain from
                                    this? As far as the rich countries were concerned, nothing. But this would be
                                    massively beneficial to small developing countries looking to reach space. They
                                    would gain advantage by commissioning their launches to ASI.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They team were overjoyed by the sensor results. The engine worked
                                    exactly as expected. The next milestone was obviously to reach orbit. Orbit was
                                    difficult as many had told before. The rocket guidance system was very difficult to
                                    master. A rocket could, in the middle of its trajectory, spin out of control, tumble
                                    back to ground, suddenly change its maneuver, gain speed, lose speed, disassemble
                                    into a thousand pieces, break apart before intended, catch fire, etc. All of these
                                    things needed to be perfectly taken care of before trying to send a rocket into
                                    space. It was a horrendously difficult challenge and many early starters
                                    weren&rsquo;t able to achieve success in this field. Would Lasin and ASI finally
                                    break that long chain of failures? Well without at least trying they wouldn&rsquo;t
                                    know. But they were ready to try. Whatever the result, they would accept it and if
                                    they failed but had enough resources to try again, they would.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Work began on upgrading the site for an orbital launch early that
                                    month. By the end of the month, it had been finished and they were ready to
                                    inaugurate their launch. The day arrived and nobody could believe it. Lasin and
                                    Akitir were sitting in a sun shade tent. They were looking over the rocket put
                                    together a week earlier lying flat at the raise bed. The bed would raise the rocket
                                    into a vertical position beside the launch mount. The mount would provide support
                                    until the rocket lifted over its height. That would conclude the job of the ground
                                    support but the main job for the crew at the flight control center would begin. They
                                    would need to monitor the state of the rocket at every millisecond and require to
                                    make on the spot decisions to stably fly the rocket in case of an issue. The control
                                    center comprised brilliant engineers from various space agencies across India and
                                    China. They had the talent and they could be trusted. What couldn&rsquo;t be trusted
                                    however was their patchy rocket assembled out of what they had in just a week or
                                    shorter time. The weldings weren&rsquo;t first class or even perfect but they were
                                    thought to be reliable enough to at least go for a test launch. Finally the fuel was
                                    also one of the most important factors in the equation. The plan of using cryogenic
                                    fuel they had decided in the beginning was discarded for a more easier plan of using
                                    cold room temperature fuel. The engine was put together with the mindset of using a
                                    normal fuel variant and not cryogenic so it was imperative to go with what had been
                                    done during testing.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All was set for launch. The tents were filled with the engineers
                                    that had come to witness a historical event. After more than 4 months of
                                    preparation, all was looking good for the final countdown. The moment almost arrived
                                    with the clock reaching around T-2 minutes when the ground station computers had
                                    detected a problem and had to stop the countdown. When the inspection crew went on
                                    to see what had initiated the halt sequence, they found out that the valve that was
                                    meant to open to allow chilled fuel to settle into the rocket fuel bay had suddenly
                                    stopped working. It was stuck so when T reached 0 seconds, the rocket would be
                                    forced to launch empty fueled.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stage 0 didn&rsquo;t consist of any water sound suppression
                                    system so when the spark plugs ignited, the roaring of the engines would not be
                                    muffled. That could cause ear damage to the ground crew sitting a kilometer away so
                                    they were each given a pair of headphones to cover their ears. The headphones were
                                    blocking the announcement speaker so they couldn&rsquo;t hear the launch stoppage
                                    signal. What&rsquo;s more was on top of that, the screen that showed the countdown
                                    had been cut off due to some guy mistakenly stepping on the monitor cord and pulling
                                    it out of the power socket. They all waited and waited for 10 minutes straight
                                    without seeing the rocket launch until finally one of the crew in the tent notified
                                    all that there had been a problem in the fuel loading sequence which had caused the
                                    launch to be stopped. Everybody was baffled. They were all excited when they had
                                    arrived there but now they would have to wait for another day or until the problem
                                    was fixed sooner.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately the problem wasn&rsquo;t fixed that day but by luck at
                                    around midnight, the valve was successfully replaced with a new one by the engineer
                                    crew. Everything looked ok now for another go at the launch. The next day looked
                                    nice for another attempt. Everybody arrived at the site. The visitors that had come
                                    to see the city from the top of the Nowagaun shifted their sight from the serene
                                    city to the launch tower. They were equally as excited as the crew. The ordinary
                                    Nepalese people, if everything moved perfectly from that day on, would not need to
                                    go abroad to witness live rocket launches. So they were lucky to be present on the
                                    first day of such a historical event.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The countdown sequence reached T-1 minutes and the fuel from the
                                    ground tanks began to flow into the rocket fuel compartment. At T-30 seconds, the
                                    speaker announced the completion of the fuel transfer from ground tanks to the
                                    rocket fuel bay. Finally at exactly T-20 seconds, the announcer announced &lsquo;go
                                    for launch.&rsquo; That meant the decision to abort or go with the launch shifted
                                    from the ground station computers to the flight computers present inside the rocket.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a rocket company that was so young and had just started out
                                    on the path of testing the core parts and the electronic peripherals, achieving the
                                    milestone of a flawless run of a gas generator engine cycle was beyond amazing. And
                                    then, not stopping at that and going on with a full scale orbital test of their own
                                    rocket was unheard of. That was the pace of ASI. They were not stopping at major
                                    milestones but pushing on towards their end goal which was framed sarcastically as
                                    reaching the neighboring Andromeda galaxy in their rocket. So as the first launch
                                    test was about to commence, the team were nervous beyond words but not in the
                                    situation of losing it all. They could go with another test if this turned out to be
                                    a failure. And with the time ticking relentlessly to T-0 that failure arrived soon
                                    enough.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The test went nothing like they expected. When the countdown
                                    reached T-0 the sudden ignition of the engine caused the inside of the rocket to
                                    lose pressure dramatically causing a dent at the side. This dent acted as a weak
                                    point for further structural collapse and the entire rocket imploded. The implosion
                                    wasn&rsquo;t dramatic, the 10 storey towering rocket broke apart at the dent line
                                    and fell down with a thud. When it reached the bottom, an explosion blew the entire
                                    rocket into a million pieces. Lasin was devastated. Akitir wasn&rsquo;t able to
                                    utter any words. Tears fell from Niban&rsquo;s eyes. Propellent engineer Raguswamy
                                    was broken to pieces along with the rocket.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This setback would set them back for a month. The complete rocket
                                    took about a month for building and they had to build another one fast while the
                                    summer didn&rsquo;t arrive. In June the site would be too hot for the ground workers
                                    to repair and equip the orbital mount for flights. It was April so with that, they
                                    had a month of pleasant weather and another one before June arrived. The
                                    construction workers were working furiously towards patching the launch mount and
                                    the workers at the manufacturing tent were also working both shifts in order to
                                    finish building another rocket by that month&apos;s end.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nepali was the default language between the workers but Lasin
                                    found it comfortable to use English when communicating with his peers because
                                    finding the right Nepali words for various parts of the rocket was impossible and
                                    frequent switching made it even more difficult for the worker overseers to
                                    understand what Lasin was trying to say. Lasin spent a lot of his time interacting
                                    with foreign clients at Ytiralugnis so his English was fluent. He had a sharp
                                    command of the English language, more so than Nepali one could argue.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rocket was finished building. It bolstered a pristine white
                                    paint and it looked much cleaner than the last one mainly because of the
                                    improvements brought to the welding department. Now they were using friction welding
                                    instead of traditional arc welding that produced very dirty looking imprints at the
                                    welding site. It was brought to the launch site with a lot of effort. These testing
                                    rockets weren&rsquo;t the full length so right now they could be hauled using trucks
                                    but the full size rockets once they began constructing would be impossible to bring
                                    to the top.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rocket was made vertical. Everybody gazed at the sight. In
                                    about 4 hours, the launch would commence once again after about a month of the first
                                    try. Everybody was hopeful this time. The wall section of the fuselage was made
                                    thicker this time and more sturdy alloy was used for the overall construction. With
                                    about an hour to go for the launch, everybody gathered in the tent and sat in their
                                    seats. Lasin, Niban and Akitir as usual were at the front fixating their eyes on the
                                    sublime rocket without any heads in front obstructing their vision.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As with the last time, the sequence of fuel loading, safety
                                    checks and commencing the countdown of the final 30 seconds to launch was done
                                    successfully. The ignition spark lighted the fuel thrusted forcefully down the
                                    nozzle by the gas generator cycle and the rocket for the first time left its pad and
                                    began to climb. Everybody held their breaths. It was climbing faster and faster and
                                    after a minute reached the apex of what human sight could see in perfect condition.
                                    Everybody was thrilled to see the absolute perfect rendition of the computer launch
                                    simulations happening in front of their eyes. They couldn&rsquo;t believe it was
                                    happening. Then when finally the moment of the rocket reaching its maximum dynamic
                                    pressure arrived, the team teared up seeing the rocket holding itself together. Even
                                    in that moment of &nbsp;extreme structural stress due to the atmospheric drag, the
                                    rocket was barely wobbling and when that phase ended, the rocket came out completely
                                    fine as indicated by the embedded electronic sensors.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nepal didn&rsquo;t have any sea. The team at ASI weren&rsquo;t so
                                    foolish to not know that every space company barring SpaceX required their booster
                                    to tumble into the sea disappearing forever after its job was done. If the empty
                                    booster instead headed back to the land, it could cause serious devastation to the
                                    people in an area.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To cope with this, the guys and gals at ASI implemented an
                                    okayish solution. They fitted their booster with a pair of parachutes. So even if
                                    the booster fell off the sky and hit the ground, it atleast lost much of its
                                    momentum to the atmosphere. So, as expected the empty booster fell gently and
                                    crashed without making a big thud. The team however, against their original plan
                                    made no effort to recover the booster because they found out that it fell across the
                                    border of Nepal and India and reached Bihar. This wasn&rsquo;t expected by the team
                                    as the calculations pointed towards the booster falling on their side of the border.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sensors inside in the upper stage of the rocket indicated
                                    that the payload which was funnily a wooden black with the words &lsquo;Andromeda we
                                    are coming!&rsquo; written on it, successfully reached orbit. That unambiguously
                                    proved that the mission was a glorious success even though the booster seemed to be
                                    lost to the neighbor.&nbsp;</p>

                                <h2 class=”section-heading”>Chapter 17</h2>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another amazing progress was made just after a month of their
                                    successful flight test. The contractors that took the task of fitting the ropeways
                                    to be used for hauling rockets to the top of the mountain gave their answer which
                                    said that the rope way was 90% complete and the gentlemen and women at ASI could
                                    start testing as early as next week. This meant that what Lasin and Niban jokingly
                                    thought of doing 6 years earlier on that cold night at the same exact spot where a
                                    launch tower was sitting now wasn&rsquo;t a joke at all. This gave indication of how
                                    gifted of a visionaries they were. Surely the spectral of ropes carrying a rocket
                                    comprising tonnes of weight would attract enthusiastic journalists from all over the
                                    world. That could only be a benefit to ASI to increase their publicity and to the
                                    whole nation as whole.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was looking like what the two of the founders saw coming 6
                                    years ago was actually going to come. So all they needed to do now was nail the task
                                    of carrying rockets, carrying payloads, launching them, generating revenue. This was
                                    the hallmark of rocket business that generated income for a space company. Doing
                                    business required a mentality that could cope with the most adverse things thrown
                                    towards achieving the business goal. One had to be resilient and adaptive and things
                                    would automatically work themselves out. What was the thing that needed to adapt?
                                    That was an unknown. The task of a great CEO was to figure out that unknown ahead of
                                    time and make the team and the company ready to face it. Lasin was exactly that. He
                                    was a great predictor. That meant the CEO was the most important part of the
                                    equation. If he/she became faulty then the company itself would become faulty.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The next few days Lasin spent his time at Ytiralugnis. He wanted to
                                    make sure that the attention he was giving to ASI wasn&rsquo;t hampering his main
                                    company in any way. So he looked at the monthly financial reports of Ytiralugnis and
                                    saw a steady growth in revenue generation. Lasin was happy with the progress so he
                                    wanted to do something else. He decided to go all in on the space venture. It
                                    wasn&rsquo;t about launching payloads for some money now. It was about expanding the
                                    reach of humanity to far away places. To do that he would need to develop the best
                                    rocket engine the world had ever seen. The hallmark of a rocket engine was the full
                                    flow staged combustion engine. That was very difficult to achieve. Nearly all who
                                    had tried to go that route had failed. Nobody in the contemporary time had an
                                    operating full flow staged combustion engine with them. Why was this technology so
                                    difficult?&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full flow staged combustion engines used something called twin
                                    turbine design. What that meant was that both the gas and the lox had separate mini
                                    turbines to kickstart the burning cycle. At first, a small amount of fuel and an
                                    equally tiny amount of lox flowed through separate intricate manifolds. The
                                    manifolds led to a preburner turbine where the liquids would combust and generate
                                    enough energy to kickstart the main turbines situated below. The main turbine
                                    wasn&rsquo;t one but there were two separate turbines each for lox and gas. The job
                                    of the two pre burners was to produce a fuel rich mixture on one end and an oxygen
                                    rich mixture on the other. These separate mixtures would combine with each other to
                                    form a very highly mixed gas oxygen fuel that would get highly pressurized at
                                    extreme temperature inside the combustion chamber. The last thing that followed all
                                    of these steps involved ignition of the pressurized fuel to violently eject it out
                                    of the nozzle at extreme velocities to generate thrust that pushed the rocket above.

                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If ASI could build a FFSCE, it would be game over. ASI though,
                                    had no expertise for building a FFSCE from ground up. If they could steal a raptor
                                    engine from SpaceX&rsquo;s starbase, then the engineers at ASI who came from
                                    Ytiralugnis could try to reverse engineer it and design one of their own. Like how
                                    AMD reverse engineered Intel&rsquo;s X86 architecture and built their own CPU. But
                                    here AMD had a big advantage. The Intel chips were freely available for the public
                                    to buy. Rocket engines on the other hand aren&rsquo;t buyable by the public for any
                                    amount of money because they are considered class a military secret. Since
                                    historically rockets were developed by the US for military purposes to compete with
                                    the Soviet Union, even today rocket technologies are a closely guarded secret. Any
                                    company that builds a rocket engine at US&rsquo;s soil is bound by the military to
                                    keep the internal technologies from being stolen by foreign nations.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ASI set out on a multi-year plan to try to build its own FFSCE
                                    from scratch which was extremely difficult even for rich nations&rsquo; governments.
                                    ASI had one advantage going for it. It was based on a nation where lots of engineers
                                    were jobless. ASI could try to get all the jobless engineers of Nepal participate on
                                    a FFSCE design competition. The submissions would be ranked and the best one from
                                    those would be picked for further design iteration internally at ASI. This would
                                    shorten the burden of trying to get the basics right which was a long and arduous
                                    process. Doing anything from scratch was very difficult.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However this plan wasn&rsquo;t looked upon with too much
                                    enthusiasm by the ASI executives. Conducting a nationwide competition would be too
                                    difficult and time consuming. Rather it would be much better to try to do it
                                    themselves. Yeah it would be time consuming but they could always figure out some
                                    ways to try to shorten that.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ASI had some things going in its favor. It was a startup so it
                                    could try to attract creditors to put money into it. ASI wouldn&rsquo;t wanna go
                                    public at this early phase but if its business went on smoothly and turned some
                                    profit, it could open its IPO. Business wise, ASI was in perfect condition. There
                                    wasn&rsquo;t anything to be concerned about. It was a fruitful looking startup that
                                    had promising employees and a good executive team.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A month passes by and the engineers at ASI figure out a way to
                                    heat gas at extreme high temperatures using a gas welding appratus to test alloys.
                                    The alloy they wanted to use for making the nozzole and chamber section of the
                                    engine was of Iron-Titanium-Steel compostion. Finally with the rig in place, the
                                    alloy was tested and they found that it was able to withstand high temperatures of a
                                    rocket fuel burning.</p>
